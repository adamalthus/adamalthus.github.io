<a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/about/jonathan-murray-profile-pic-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-682"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-682" title="Jonathan Murray Profile Pic" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jonathan-Murray-Profile-Pic.jpg?resize=139%2C210" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Jonathan (Adamalthus) was most recently EVP & Chief Technology Officer at&nbsp;Warner Music Group (WMG) where he&nbsp;was responsible for the company&rsquo;s global technology strategy. In&nbsp;this role he&nbsp;drove the transformation of&nbsp;WMG&rsquo;s technology delivery capabilities including the design and implementation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;state-of-the-art&nbsp;&mdash; cloud based&nbsp;&mdash; software factory platform, and new organizational and process models designed for continuous value delivery.

Jonathan created the concept of a ‘<a title="The Composable Enterprise™" href="http://www.adamalthus.com/blog/2013/04/04/the-composable-enterprise/" target="_blank">Composable Enterprise</a>', which provides a&nbsp;radical blueprint for enabling highly adaptive and agile business models enabled by&nbsp;modern software architectures and platforms. He&nbsp;believes that ‘Time-to-Value' should be&nbsp;the key success metric for all enterprise technology organizations and that a&nbsp;comprehensive transformation of&nbsp;enterprise software platforms, processes and organization structures will be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;accomplish this. His agenda-defining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIg7TO0CaKA" target="_blank">presentation at&nbsp;the 2013 Cloud Foundry summit</a> is&nbsp;widely seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;road-map for next generation of&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;IT.

Jonathan is&nbsp;a&nbsp;published research fellow with the Berkeley Roundtable on&nbsp;the International Economy at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;California, Berkeley. He&nbsp;is a&nbsp;regular speaker on&nbsp;cloud computing technology and policy issues and an&nbsp;advisor to&nbsp;several technology investment funds, the World Bank, European Commission and the OECD. In&nbsp;2012 was recognized as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the leading <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/24762/three-cloud-visionaries-in-2012/" target="_blank">cloud-computing visionaries</a> and in&nbsp;2014 Jonathan was elected to&nbsp;The Economist&rsquo;s ‘Agenda Digital 50'.

Previously, Jonathan spent sixteen years in&nbsp;various executive roles with Microsoft including Vice President of&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s Public Sector Technology Office and Vice President of&nbsp;Global Account Sales where he&nbsp;was responsible for leading the company&rsquo;s engagement with its top 40 enterprise customers. He&nbsp;has an&nbsp;extensive background in&nbsp;software engineering, architecture and systems design.

Jonathan can be&nbsp;found on&nbsp;Twitter as [@Adamalthus](http://twitter.com/adamalthus). He&nbsp;lives in&nbsp;New York with his partner Desiree van Welsum, an&nbsp;economist and senior&nbsp;IT policy advisor at&nbsp;the World Bank.
