Adamalthus is&nbsp;the concatenation of&nbsp;the first name of 'Adam' Smith and the Last name of&nbsp;Thomas Robert 'Malthus' two of&nbsp;the most influential thinkers of&nbsp;their time whose ideas still resonate nearly three centuries later.

You can read their extensive biographies here for <a title="Adam Smith" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_smith" target="_blank">Smith</a> and here for <a title="Thomas Malthus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus" target="_blank">Malthus</a>.

Smith is&nbsp;recognized as&nbsp;the father of&nbsp;modern economics and specifically one of&nbsp;the first theorists in&nbsp;political economy.

He&nbsp;outlined two central propositions in&nbsp;his book _<a title="The Wealth of Nations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" target="_blank">An&nbsp;Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of&nbsp;the Wealth of&nbsp;Nations</a>._ 

The first of&nbsp;these propositions is&nbsp;the 'Pin Factory' a&nbsp;device Adam&rsquo;s uses to&nbsp;explain that increasing specialization and division of&nbsp;labor leads to&nbsp;ever greater economies of&nbsp;scale which are ultimately limited by&nbsp;the &laquo;Extent of&nbsp;the market.&raquo;

Smith&rsquo;s second proposition was the 'Invisible hand' which is&nbsp;more abstract but can be&nbsp;understood as&nbsp;the self correcting nature of&nbsp;markets where the actions of 'Self interested' individuals trading in&nbsp;a&nbsp;free market lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect equilibrium between prices and the amount of&nbsp;goods produced.

With these ideas Smith laid the foundations for modern market economics.

In&nbsp;his excellent book <a style="&quot;width: 120px; height: 240px;" title="Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393329887?ie=UTF8&tag=adamalthus-20 " target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Knowledge and the Wealth of&nbsp;Nations</a> David Warsh points out that Smith&rsquo;s two central ideas are essentially in&nbsp;conflict. Increasing improvements in&nbsp;efficiency and economies of&nbsp;scale in&nbsp;the 'Pin Factory' would tend to&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;the formation of&nbsp;monopolistic positions for first movers. Yet self interest and competition inherent in&nbsp;the 'Invisible hand' will tend to&nbsp;keep prices at&nbsp;the lowest possible level and will prevent any manufacturer from achieving an&nbsp;advantage in&nbsp;the market. The 'Invisible hand' will tend to&nbsp;limit the supply of&nbsp;goods to&nbsp;perfectly match the demand for those goods. As&nbsp;Warsh eloquently explains it&nbsp;would take nearly three centuries for economists to&nbsp;understand how that conflict is&nbsp;resolved in&nbsp;the real world.

The Revd. Thomas Robert Malthus was ten years old when Smith published _The Wealth of&nbsp;Nations._ He&nbsp;became a&nbsp;highly influential scholar in&nbsp;the fields of&nbsp;economics, science and social issues.

He&nbsp;is&nbsp;most influential for his writing and ideas on&nbsp;population growth and is&nbsp;recognized as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the first demographers. Where Smith saw a&nbsp;society benefiting from economic growth driven by&nbsp;specialization and free markets, Malthus had a&nbsp;contrary view.

In&nbsp;his book _[An&nbsp;Essay on&nbsp;the Principle of&nbsp;Population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population "An Essay on the Principle of Population") <span style="font-style: normal;">Malthus predicted that the power of&nbsp;population growth would outstrip the ability of&nbsp;agriculture to&nbsp;provide enough food for the expanding population. This simple, but highly influential idea has been expanded over time into the broader concept of a <a title="Malthusian Catastrophe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe" target="_blank">Malthusian catastrophe</a> where economic or&nbsp;natural resource limits are seen as&nbsp;placing an&nbsp;ultimate boundary on&nbsp;the growth of&nbsp;the human population.</span>_

_<span style="font-style: normal;">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;relevant that both Smith and Malthus' ideas were put forward during an&nbsp;early stage of&nbsp;the industrial revolution. Not surprisingly, their various theories do&nbsp;not internalize the profound effect that technological improvement would have on&nbsp;economies and societies.</span>_

Mathus' theories about exponential population growth were correct; the global population has grown exponentially since his time. However, technology lead improvements in&nbsp;crop yields and agricultural production have enabled us&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;produce enough food to&nbsp;feed this growing population (Not withstanding the frequent famines witnessed in&nbsp;Africa that have more to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with our ability and willingness to&nbsp;make sure that surplus food production is&nbsp;distributed effectively around the world.) In&nbsp;this regard his theory that linear improvements in&nbsp;agricultural production would place limits on&nbsp;an&nbsp;exponentially growing population proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;false.

_<span style="font-style: normal;">It&nbsp;has now been recognized that the production and distribution of 'Knowledge' increasingly aided by&nbsp;technological improvement was the key to&nbsp;resolving the conflict in&nbsp;Smith&rsquo;s two great propositions. Ultimately the thing that enables one manufacturer to&nbsp;gain advantage over another even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;market with perfect competition is 'Innovation'.</span>_

_<span style="font-style: normal;">The ideas of&nbsp;Smith and Malthus still define the greatest challenge facing our global society. Can we&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;chase growth as&nbsp;an&nbsp;economic ideal without exceeding the carrying capacity of&nbsp;the planet; triggering the ultimate Malthusian catastrophe? </span>_

_<span style="font-style: normal;">Growing up&nbsp;as a&nbsp;child of&nbsp;the late 60s&nbsp;&mdash; watching the moon landings and being the first generation to&nbsp;have access to&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal computer&nbsp;&mdash; I&nbsp;have always had an&nbsp;optimistic view about technology&rsquo;s ultimate ability to&nbsp;help us&nbsp;innovate our way out of&nbsp;danger. With maturity and the experience of&nbsp;traveling around the world for the last 25 years seeing the complete range of&nbsp;economic, social and environmental challenges I&nbsp;am&nbsp;no longer so&nbsp;sure.</span>_

_<span style="font-style: normal;">Perhaps the most significant influence on&nbsp;my&nbsp;personal philosophy was a&nbsp;chance meeting with the renowned political economist <a title="John Zysman" href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/person_detail.php?person=261" target="_blank">John Zysman</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;European Commission foresite conference back in&nbsp;2005 (</span>_I&nbsp;now count John as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;closest friends.) It&nbsp;was John that helped me&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand that society&rsquo;s ability to&nbsp;tap technology&rsquo;s full potential is&nbsp;ultimately constrained by&nbsp;political and cultural frameworks and decision making.

The human race has faced its share of&nbsp;challenges. The <a title="Toba Catastrophe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory" target="_blank">Toba Catastrophe Theory</a> proposes that a&nbsp;super volcanic eruption some 70,000 years ago initiated a 'Nuclear winter' which lead to&nbsp;an&nbsp;extended period of&nbsp;global cooling. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;proposed that this event had the effect of&nbsp;reducing the total global hominid population to&nbsp;no&nbsp;more that 10&minus;15,000 individuals. From that group the human race evolved into what it&nbsp;is&nbsp;today. Creativity and innovation were the keys to&nbsp;their survival and the creation of&nbsp;our opportunity.

The challenges facing the human race today are profound: Climate change, fresh water supplies and nuclear proliferation amongst many. My&nbsp;interests lie in&nbsp;how we&nbsp;will, or&nbsp;will not, innovate our way through these challenges, technologically, socially and politically?
