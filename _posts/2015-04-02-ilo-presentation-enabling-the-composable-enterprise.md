<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/peter-temes/2/588/170/en" target="_blank">Peter Temes</a>&nbsp;&mdash; Founder and President of&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.iloinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Innovation in&nbsp;Large Organizations (ILO)</a>&nbsp;&mdash; was kind enough to&nbsp;invite me&nbsp;to&nbsp;speak on&nbsp;enabling the '[Composable Enterprise](http://www.adamalthus.com/blog/2013/04/04/the-composable-enterprise/ "The Composable Enterpriseâ„¢")'&trade; at&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent meeting of&nbsp;the institute&rsquo;s members in&nbsp;New York. <!--more--> A&nbsp;PDF of&nbsp;the presentation can found 

<a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Enabling-The-Composable-Enterprise-ILO.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Peter has put together a&nbsp;stellar program with an 'A list' corporate membership. The discussions at&nbsp;these events are always fascinating and informative. The discussion that followed last week&rsquo;s presentation got into some very interesting topics such as&nbsp;ethics of&nbsp;automation, an&nbsp;important topic indeed.
