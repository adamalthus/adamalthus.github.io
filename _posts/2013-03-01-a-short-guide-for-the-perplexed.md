Over the last couple of&nbsp;years the term _cloud_ _computing_ has become become public relations shorthand for &laquo;Look, look, we&rsquo;re also cool.&raquo; The expression is&nbsp;now so&nbsp;overused and is&nbsp;applied so&nbsp;widely that it&nbsp;has become almost meaningless. That&rsquo;s a&nbsp;problem. Senior business decision makers have been set a&nbsp;drift in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sea of&nbsp;PR and marketing confusion just at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;making strategic technology choices that may directly impact the future of&nbsp;their firms. I&nbsp;offer this brief guide to&nbsp;cloud computing in&nbsp;an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;help cut through the fog currently enveloping this important topic.

Let&rsquo;s start with a&nbsp;formal definition of&nbsp;cloud:

> <div title="Page 4">
>   The provision of&nbsp;computing infrastructure, platform or&nbsp;application service as&nbsp;a&nbsp;utility, which can be&nbsp;consumed by&nbsp;any Internet connected device, using open standard protocols where variability in&nbsp;demand is&nbsp;satisfied through the dynamic and automatic provisioning of&nbsp;pooled hardware, network, and software service resources providing the illusion of&nbsp;infinite scalability and are generally billed for on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pay-as-you-go basis.

<div title="Page 4">
  <p>
    Now we&nbsp;can deconstruct this definition to&nbsp;hopefully separate reality from hype.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>The provision of&nbsp;computing infrastructure, platform or&nbsp;application service as&nbsp;a&nbsp;utility&nbsp;&mdash; </em>Cloud computing is&nbsp;composed of&nbsp;three complimentary layers of&nbsp;service.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Infrastructure as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service </em>(IaaS) is&nbsp;where all the basic computing resources&nbsp;&mdash; computation (CPU), program memory, disk storage and network connections&nbsp;&mdash; are managed and allocated to&nbsp;higher level software services and applications as&nbsp;needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Platform as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service </em>(PaaS)&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;higher level software services that are used by&nbsp;software developers to&nbsp;build cloud based applications. PaaS might include services such as&nbsp;security and authentication, data access and transaction logging.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Software as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service </em>(SaaS) is&nbsp;the highest level of&nbsp;cloud service consisting of&nbsp;the applications directly consumed by&nbsp;end users generally through a&nbsp;web browser and without the need to&nbsp;install software locally on&nbsp;the users&nbsp;PC.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;helpful shorthand for each of&nbsp;these layers of&nbsp;cloud computing service: IaaS is&nbsp;a&nbsp;computing <em>resource management model, PaaS</em> is a <em>software development model</em> and SaaS is&nbsp;an <em>application delivery model</em>.
  </p>
</div>

<div title="Page 4">
  <p>
    The description of&nbsp;these services layers as a <em>Utility</em> means that they are consistently available at&nbsp;any time and accessible from anywhere.
  </p>
</div>

<p title="Page 4">
  <em>Which can be&nbsp;consumed by&nbsp;any internet connected device, using open standard protocols</em>&nbsp;&mdash; In&nbsp;general cloud based applications and services can be&nbsp;accessed by&nbsp;any device that can connect to&nbsp;the internet using standard internet protocols. Generally a&nbsp;web browser would be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;an&nbsp;end-user to&nbsp;access services. However, native applications on&nbsp;smart phones may also be&nbsp;the interface through which users connect.
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  <em>Where variability in&nbsp;demand is&nbsp;satisfied through the dynamic and automatic provisioning of&nbsp;pooled hardware, network, and software service resource&nbsp;&mdash; </em>This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the key differentiators of&nbsp;cloud computing which separates marketing spin from reality. For a&nbsp;service to&nbsp;truly be&nbsp;considered as&nbsp;cloud computing it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;able to <em>automatically</em> scale up&nbsp;and down to&nbsp;meet variations in&nbsp;demand. Hosting a&nbsp;website on&nbsp;an&nbsp;internet server&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;servers&nbsp;&mdash; does not qualify as&nbsp;cloud computing because if&nbsp;demand exceeds the capacity of&nbsp;the underlying hardware then human intervention is&nbsp;required to&nbsp;either add additional servers or&nbsp;to&nbsp;move the workload to&nbsp;a&nbsp;larger capacity machine. Cloud services make these adjustments automatically.
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  <em>Providing the illusion of&nbsp;infinite scalability </em>&mdash;&nbsp;Users of&nbsp;true cloud computing services never experience a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;resource due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;excess of&nbsp;demand. Cloud provider organizations constantly build out their infrastructures so&nbsp;that available capacity always exceeds near-term user demand. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the 'Illusion' of&nbsp;infinite capacity that separates cloud architecture from more traditional forms of&nbsp;hosted computing infrastructure.
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  <em id="__mceDel"><em>Generally billed for on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pay-as-you-go basis&nbsp;&mdash; </em></em>Though not universally the case, the charge for cloud computing services is&nbsp;normally based on&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;computing resource consumed over time. This is&nbsp;the model general used for IaaS services. This compares the fixed or&nbsp;contract pricing models used for more traditional hosted application services.
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  True cloud services should meet all the the criteria outlined above but in&nbsp;particular they should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;provision new services and scale automatically based on&nbsp;fluctuating consumer demand without human intervention. Services being sold as&nbsp;&laquo;Cloud&raquo; which come with fixed capacity limits or&nbsp;obligations to&nbsp;purchase defined hardware configurations are&nbsp;&mdash; by&nbsp;definition&nbsp;&mdash; nothing of&nbsp;the sort.
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  There is&nbsp;one other aspect to&nbsp;cloud computing that creates significant confusion: How it&nbsp;is&nbsp;deployed? There are three accepted models of&nbsp;cloud deployment: <em>Public, Private and Hybrid.</em>
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  <em>Public Cloud </em>is&nbsp;where an&nbsp;application is&nbsp;deployed on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cloud infrastructure that is&nbsp;shared by&nbsp;multiple customers and is&nbsp;directly accessible over the internet. The most commonly used public cloud service is <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon&rsquo;s Web Services</a>. Other public cloud environments include <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">Google&rsquo;s App Engine</a>. Unfortunately the <em>Public</em> deployment model is&nbsp;often made synonymous with the term <em>cloud computing</em>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not.<em id="__mceDel"><br /> </em>
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  <em>Private Cloud</em> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cloud infrastructure that is&nbsp;dedicated to&nbsp;one particular customer. The environment may be&nbsp;run behind a&nbsp;firewall in&nbsp;the customer&rsquo;s own data center or&nbsp;it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;run for the customer by&nbsp;a&nbsp;third party. In&nbsp;either case the private cloud resources are dedicated to&nbsp;the needs of&nbsp;one company or&nbsp;organization. Due to&nbsp;privacy and security concerns, government&rsquo;s are likely to&nbsp;create private cloud infrastructures that are shared by&nbsp;multiple agencies or&nbsp;ministries.
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  <em>Hybrid Cloud</em> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;deployment choice where public and private cloud infrastructures are linked together. A&nbsp;company may choose to&nbsp;run certain sensitive workloads on&nbsp;its dedicated private cloud infrastructure while running less sensitive workloads on&nbsp;a&nbsp;public cloud infrastructure. The two environments are joined together to&nbsp;give application users a&nbsp;seamless experience. A&nbsp;company may also temporarily utilize public cloud infrastructure capacity to&nbsp;help manage peak demand that exceeds the capacity of&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s private cloud infrastructure.
</p>

<p title="Page 4">
  We&nbsp;now have a&nbsp;complete definition of&nbsp;cloud computing: <em>Cloud Computing</em> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific form of&nbsp;systems architecture&nbsp;&mdash; meeting the criteria outlined above&nbsp;&mdash; plus a&nbsp;particular approach to&nbsp;resource management and application development and delivery. This cloud architecture can then be&nbsp;deployed either publicly on&nbsp;a&nbsp;shared infrastructure, privately on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dedicated infrastructure or&nbsp;in a <em>hybrid</em> of&nbsp;public and private.
