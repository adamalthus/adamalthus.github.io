The answer to&nbsp;that question is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big yes if&nbsp;you believe the results of a <a title="Study" href="http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/About/publications/working-papers/pdf/wp_08_12.pdf" target="_blank">large study</a> carried out by&nbsp;Professors Malamud of&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Chicago and his collaborator, Cristian Pop-Eleches of&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Columbia. This is&nbsp;not the first time that research has pointed to&nbsp;PCs in&nbsp;the home having a&nbsp;negative effect on&nbsp;student academic achievement. I&nbsp;read about the study last month but was prompted to&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;it&nbsp;by Randall Stross' very interesting article in&nbsp;the <a title="NY Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/business/11digi.html" target="_blank">NY&nbsp;Times</a> this week.

The basic finding of&nbsp;these multiple studies is&nbsp;that student academic achievement declines after the introduction of a&nbsp;PC and broadband connection in&nbsp;their home. Disturbingly, the impact is&nbsp;most pronounced with children living in&nbsp;lower income homes i.e. the very group you would intuitively think would benefit most.

In&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion, while the effect may be&nbsp;real (The sample sizes are very large and across multiple geographies) the conclusions being drawn are dangerously wrong.

To&nbsp;accept the findings of&nbsp;the study you also have to&nbsp;accept the logical counter conclusion that low income students would be _better off_ academically if&nbsp;they were not distracted by&nbsp;having an&nbsp;Internet connected&nbsp;PC at&nbsp;home. Every fiber of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body tells me&nbsp;that this conclusion cannot be&nbsp;correct.

Having wrestled with this contradiction since reading about the study back in&nbsp;May I&nbsp;have arrived at&nbsp;my&nbsp;own conclusions. The problem with the study findings is&nbsp;bound up&nbsp;in&nbsp;what is&nbsp;being measured i.e. _academic_ achievement.

We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;society and increasingly face a&nbsp;future where the&nbsp;PC and the Internet have become the basic tools of&nbsp;economic value creation. In&nbsp;the 17th century you needed to&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;join wood or&nbsp;bend iron. Today you need to&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;access and interpret information, how to&nbsp;draw you own conclusions, how to&nbsp;synthesize new ideas and how to&nbsp;communicate those ideas to&nbsp;an&nbsp;increasingly distributed set of&nbsp;collaborators.

In&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion the conclusions being drawn from this study say far more about foundational problems in&nbsp;our academic system; what is&nbsp;taught and how we&nbsp;assess student&rsquo;s readiness to&nbsp;enter a&nbsp;21st century workforce. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;largely the case (Exceptions do&nbsp;exist) that the _public_ K-12 system is&nbsp;still designed to&nbsp;turn out workers for a&nbsp;19th century industrial economy. We&nbsp;teach kids how to&nbsp;learn facts, be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;follow instruction and to&nbsp;respect authority. If&nbsp;you are lucky enough to&nbsp;come from a&nbsp;middle or&nbsp;upper income family you can of&nbsp;course obtain a&nbsp;much more progressive and technology enabled education in&nbsp;the _private_ sector.

What these studies tell us&nbsp;is&nbsp;that the affected students got worse at&nbsp;doing standardized tests. I&nbsp;would ask _so&nbsp;what_? We&nbsp;already know that family income level has a&nbsp;profound effect on&nbsp;standardized testing scores which impacts the long term economic potential of&nbsp;children from these environments. The problem isn&rsquo;t the kids or&nbsp;the&nbsp;PC the problem is&nbsp;an&nbsp;education system which is&nbsp;has an&nbsp;inbuilt biased against them.

That standardized testing has become the single determinant of&nbsp;academic achievement borders on&nbsp;the criminal. When I&nbsp;hire talent for my&nbsp;business I&nbsp;am&nbsp;not interested in&nbsp;their standardized test scores. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;know if&nbsp;they can think creatively, solve problems, communicate their ideas effectively and are smart enough to&nbsp;know that life is&nbsp;about learning all the time. These studies do&nbsp;not tell us&nbsp;anything about how access to&nbsp;PCs and the Internet might possibly improve or&nbsp;develop these skills. It&nbsp;might just be&nbsp;the case that collaborative problem solving with a&nbsp;network of&nbsp;friends on&nbsp;FaceBook is&nbsp;a&nbsp;far more valuable economic life skill than leraning to&nbsp;remember the who was the 33rd President of&nbsp;the United States.

I&nbsp;really do&nbsp;believe that these studies are dangerous. The danger is&nbsp;that they will become an&nbsp;impediment to&nbsp;programs which are focused on&nbsp;closing a&nbsp;very important digital divide that exists between rich and poor families and between rich and poor nations. I&nbsp;can&rsquo;t help believing that a&nbsp;similar research project in&nbsp;the 17th century would have found that having a&nbsp;hammer, saw, wood and nails in&nbsp;the home was distracting children from their religious studies. Pause for a&nbsp;second before you conclude that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;ridiculous analogy.
