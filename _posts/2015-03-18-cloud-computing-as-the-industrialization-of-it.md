Our drive to&nbsp;solve the Time-to-Value problem and to&nbsp;implement continuous value delivery have deep rooted connections to&nbsp;the mass production innovations of&nbsp;Ford, the scientific management disciplines of&nbsp;Taylor and the far reaching Lean Production System invented by&nbsp;Toyota. As&nbsp;IT professionals we&nbsp;have&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;my&nbsp;view&nbsp;&mdash; much to&nbsp;learn from the rich industrial heritage of&nbsp;high volume manufacturing processes.

I&nbsp;recently had the opportunity to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;views on&nbsp;cloud computing and it&rsquo;s implications for developing economies at&nbsp;the World Bank in&nbsp;DC. Preparing for this talk gave me&nbsp;the opportunity to&nbsp;crystalize my&nbsp;thinking on&nbsp;the Cloud-Manufacturing analogy and are synthesized in&nbsp;the slides I&nbsp;presented which can be&nbsp;downloaded <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cloud-and-Industrialization-of-IT-Final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
