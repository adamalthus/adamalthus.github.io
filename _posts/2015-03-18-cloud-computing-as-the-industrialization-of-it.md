Our drive to solve the Time-to-Value problem and to implement continuous value delivery have deep rooted connections to the mass production innovations of Ford, the scientific management disciplines of Taylor and the far reaching Lean Production System invented by Toyota. As IT professionals we have - in my view - much to learn from the rich industrial heritage of high volume manufacturing processes.

I recently had the opportunity to share my views on cloud computing and it's implications for developing economies at the World Bank in DC. Preparing for this talk gave me the opportunity to crystalize my thinking on the Cloud-Manufacturing analogy and are synthesized in the slides I presented which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cloud-and-Industrialization-of-IT-Final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
