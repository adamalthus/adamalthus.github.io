This weeks Partner&rsquo;s conference has once again exposed Microsoft&rsquo;s complete lack of&nbsp;any credible consumer strategy. On&nbsp;the one hand Ballmer claims he&rsquo;s going to&nbsp;leave no&nbsp;&laquo;<a href="http://onforb.es/PLy1R1" target="_blank">stone unturned</a>&raquo; competing with Apple. Yet on&nbsp;the same day he&nbsp;also states that Microsoft&rsquo;s own Windows 8 hardware &laquo;<a href="http://j.mp/LNfRJU " target="_blank">Surface is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;design point.</a>&raquo; Note to&nbsp;Steve: Those are two mutually incompatible objectives.

If&nbsp;Ballmer really is&nbsp;serious about competing with Apple then Microsoft will need to&nbsp;control its own hardware destiny&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;pcs, tablets and smartphones&nbsp;&mdash; and be&nbsp;completely committed to&nbsp;that strategy. Unfortunately that will also require a&nbsp;willingness to&nbsp;throw the OEM partner community under the bus. Protecting OEMs while aggressively competing with Apple are incompatible strategies. A&nbsp;textbook case of&nbsp;the Innovators dilemma.

Shareholders are likely to&nbsp;pay a&nbsp;very high price if&nbsp;Ballmer continues to&nbsp;believe the fantasy that he&nbsp;can accomplish both these competing objectives and still be&nbsp;successful in&nbsp;the consumer business.
