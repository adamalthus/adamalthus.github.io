Welcome to&nbsp;the era of&nbsp;the 'Metaform' - The Platform of&nbsp;Everything.<!--more-->

In&nbsp;software a ‘Platform' is&nbsp;an&nbsp;integrated set of&nbsp;technologies accessible through standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) upon which new software applications and services can be&nbsp;built.

The economic potential of&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform results from the breadth and depth of&nbsp;functionality encapsulated by&nbsp;the platform, how accessible the platform is&nbsp;to&nbsp;developers and consumers.

As&nbsp;software platforms have evolved they have become increasingly abstracted from the underlying infrastructures on&nbsp;which they run. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result modern software platforms have evolved away from merely exposing low level hardware and network functions towards higher levels of&nbsp;business capability.

Firms routinely today expose their business processes and functions to&nbsp;the outside world via APIs. UPS and Fedex do&nbsp;this to&nbsp;enable other firms to&nbsp;integrate with their logistics services. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;very real sense business processes and even whole businesses are becoming digital service platforms.

New startups such as [Shyp] use the platforms of&nbsp;other logistics firms to&nbsp;build their own higher level service offerings. In&nbsp;Shyp&rsquo;s case they offer on-demand pickup, packing and shipping of&nbsp;goods for consumers.

The travel booking service [Trivago] is&nbsp;built on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the platforms of&nbsp;other travel services such as&nbsp;Expedia, Orbitz and others to&nbsp;offer consumers the ability to&nbsp;search for the best travel offers without visiting each individual website.

We&nbsp;are now entering the era of&nbsp;the ‘Meta' platform&nbsp;&mdash; the ‘Metaform' - where a&nbsp;new generation of&nbsp;startups increasingly construct new services by&nbsp;composing together the digital business functions and processes of&nbsp;other firms.

There will be&nbsp;unimaginable opportunity for new service innovation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where the core business functions and capabilities of&nbsp;the widest range of&nbsp;businesses across all industrial sectors are available as&nbsp;building blocks to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wired together in&nbsp;new and interesting ways.

On&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the balance sheet the ‘Metaform' is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;provide companies with a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;unlock the value of&nbsp;their existing internal capabilities by&nbsp;exposing them to&nbsp;demand from the outside world.

There are substantial issues to&nbsp;overcome to&nbsp;realize the full potential of ‘Metaform' not the least of&nbsp;which includes: working out how to&nbsp;automate and streamline the payment and contractual terms between component service providers and protecting consumer data as&nbsp;it&nbsp;flows through the systems of&nbsp;multiple independent entities. But, the enormity of&nbsp;the global opportunity for a&nbsp;new wave of&nbsp;digital service innovation is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;see these issues resolved.

Companies such as&nbsp;Shyp, Trivago and others are pioneers of&nbsp;the 'Metaform' opportunity but they are but early indicators of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very profound transformation of&nbsp;the digital services economy and a&nbsp;tidal wave of&nbsp;service innovation we&rsquo;re about to&nbsp;witness in&nbsp;the years ahead.
