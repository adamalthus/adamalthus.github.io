In&nbsp;various corporate meeting rooms at&nbsp;Samsung, Microsoft, HP, RIM and Google eager teams of&nbsp;engineers, marketing folks and freshly minted MBAs are trying to&nbsp;figure out the magic formula which will deliver a&nbsp;product to&nbsp;compete with Apple&rsquo;s iPad. Hopefully they were all paying attention in&nbsp;high-school because the first steps to&nbsp;understanding the dynamics of&nbsp;this type of&nbsp;platform competition were almost certainly covered in&nbsp;chemistry class.<!--more-->

It&nbsp;turns out that the field of&nbsp;chemical reaction dynamics provides a&nbsp;rather neat model which explains why Apple&rsquo;s competitors are finding it&nbsp;so&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;gain traction against the iPad. Indeed this abstract model is&nbsp;generally applicable to&nbsp;all situations where an&nbsp;existing product is&nbsp;being challenged by&nbsp;new entrants.

**Chemical Reaction Dynamics**

The progress of&nbsp;many chemical reactions can be&nbsp;illustrated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;potential energy diagram such as&nbsp;the one shown below.

In&nbsp;chemistry terms X&Y represent states of&nbsp;equilibrium. X&nbsp;is&nbsp;the starting point and Y&nbsp;is&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chemical reaction pathway. The interesting part of&nbsp;this model is&nbsp;the peak in&nbsp;the middle which can be&nbsp;viewed as&nbsp;an&nbsp;&laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; which needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;overcome to&nbsp;move from one state to&nbsp;the next i. e&nbsp;for the chemical reaction to&nbsp;proceed. The height of&nbsp;this barrier defines the amount of&nbsp;&laquo;Activation Energy&raquo; required to&nbsp;initiate the chemical reaction.

A&nbsp;common example would be&nbsp;the striking of&nbsp;a&nbsp;match. The un-struck match sitting in&nbsp;its matchbox is&nbsp;represented by&nbsp;state X&nbsp;in&nbsp;the diagram. However, when you draw a&nbsp;&mdash; non-safety&nbsp;&mdash; match across a&nbsp;rough surface the heat from friction provides enough activation energy to&nbsp;initiate the chemical combustion of&nbsp;the phosphorous in&nbsp;the match head. Resulting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;transition from state X&nbsp;&mdash; un-combusted phosphorous&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;state Y: the burnt match and the by-products of&nbsp;phosphorus combustion.

The model also illustrates the role of&nbsp;catalysts in&nbsp;promoting chemical reactions. Catalysts act to&nbsp;reduce the amount of&nbsp;&laquo;Activation Energy&raquo; required for the reaction to&nbsp;proceed i.e. they lower the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo;. How they do&nbsp;this is&nbsp;irrelevant for this discussion but the concept and role of a&nbsp;&laquo;Catalyst&raquo; is&nbsp;critical to&nbsp;the model when applied to&nbsp;the economics of&nbsp;platform competition as&nbsp;will be&nbsp;shown below.

**Applying The Model to&nbsp;The Economics of&nbsp;Platform Competition**

The chemical reaction dynamics model can be&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;the economics of&nbsp;platform competition. In&nbsp;this case state X&nbsp;represents the iPads current dominant position in&nbsp;the market for tablet devices. State Y&nbsp;represents a&nbsp;future market state that could take many forms. State Y&nbsp;might represent and situation where the market has both grown in&nbsp;size but where Apple&rsquo;s competitors have also established defensible and sustainable positions. Another state Y' might see the iPad being overthrown completely and some other vendor&rsquo;s product establishing its own dominant position. In&nbsp;yet another state Y'' tablets themselves may&nbsp;&mdash; <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/110330/p4#a110330p4" target="_blank">as&nbsp;some have predicted</a>&nbsp;&mdash; become irrelevant with consumers preferring a&nbsp;different form factor or&nbsp;device configuration altogether.

Each of&nbsp;the potential future states of&nbsp;the market for tablets requires a&nbsp;transition from state X&nbsp;&mdash; the reality of&nbsp;today&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;some future state Y. What is&nbsp;clear is&nbsp;that in&nbsp;each case the &laquo;Activation Energy&raquo; required to&nbsp;initiate each of&nbsp;the transitions outlined above would be&nbsp;different. The transition from X->Y will require less &laquo;Activation Energy&raquo; than a&nbsp;transition from X->Y' or&nbsp;even X->Y''. In&nbsp;chemistry the height of&nbsp;the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; is&nbsp;determined by a&nbsp;a&nbsp;few well defined factors; most notably the strength of&nbsp;the chemical bonds which need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;broken in&nbsp;order for the reaction to&nbsp;proceed.

When applying the model to&nbsp;the economics of&nbsp;platform competition there are a&nbsp;more complex series of&nbsp;factors which affect the height of&nbsp;this potential barrier. Incumbents who are trying to&nbsp;maintain the current state must act to&nbsp;increase the size of&nbsp;the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; i.e. to&nbsp;ensure that competitors must expend more &laquo;Energy&raquo;&nbsp;&mdash; marketing, R&D, sales effort etc. &mdash;&nbsp;to&nbsp;climb accomplish their goals. Competitors on&nbsp;the other hand must be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;provide the &laquo;Activation Energy&raquo; required to&nbsp;overcome the incumbents established position. Alternatively&nbsp;&mdash; and most importantly&nbsp;&mdash; competitors must try to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;&laquo;Catalyst&raquo; which dramatically lowers the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; and provides the opportunity for a&nbsp;state transition to&nbsp;take place.

**A&nbsp;Real World Example: The Tech World&nbsp;vs. Apple**

Applying the model specifically to&nbsp;the iPad scenario the various factors at&nbsp;play to&nbsp;both maintain&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;increase the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; or&nbsp;to&nbsp;lower it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;summarized as&nbsp;follows.

Incumbent: Apple&nbsp;&mdash; _Raising &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo;_

  1. Delivering Ease of&nbsp;use
  2. Touch technology*
  3. Consistent quality of&nbsp;end-user experience*
  4. Integrated end-to-end services (iTunes)
  5. Depth and breadth of&nbsp;application ecosystem
  6. Seamless integration with iCloud
  7. Retail experience
  8. Purchasing preference inertia

Competitors: Samsung, HP, Microsoft, Google, RIM&nbsp;&mdash; _Overcoming the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo;_

  1. Investing in&nbsp;broad-reach marketing (Samsung)
  2. Multi-channel distribution (All)
  3. User device choice and multi-OEM distribution (Microsoft)
  4. Operating System Innovation (HP & Microsoft & RIM)
  5. Enhanced usability&nbsp;&mdash; User Interface Innovation (Microsoft & HP)
  6. Free (Google)*
  7. Open Ecosystem (Google)*

* &laquo;Catalytic&raquo;

For Apple the set of&nbsp;actions embodied in&nbsp;items 1&minus;6 above have placed them in&nbsp;an&nbsp;enviable&nbsp;&mdash; and dominant&nbsp;&mdash; market position. The combined effect of&nbsp;these actions together with this market position lead to&nbsp;item 7 on&nbsp;the list&nbsp;&mdash; purchasing preference inertia. Word of&nbsp;mouth and customer satisfaction make the iPad _the_ device to&nbsp;buy. In&nbsp;the eyes of&nbsp;many consumers you would be&nbsp;stupid not&nbsp;to. Its is&nbsp;perhaps this factor that has the greatest long-term influence on&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; surrounding Apple&rsquo;s iPad.

As&nbsp;mentioned above, catalysts play a&nbsp;critical role in&nbsp;promoting many important chemical reactions. The same is&nbsp;true in&nbsp;the economics of&nbsp;platform competition. The iPad is&nbsp;a&nbsp;derivative of&nbsp;the original iPhone and that device overcame an&nbsp;established market state to&nbsp;achieve its current position. Before the launch of&nbsp;iPhone, Apple was playing the role of&nbsp;competitor trying to&nbsp;find ways to&nbsp;lower the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; raised by&nbsp;Nokia, RIM, and Microsoft in&nbsp;the smartphone market. For Apple, new &laquo;Touch Screen&raquo; technology combined with an&nbsp;integrated end-user experience was the &laquo;Catalyst&raquo; which effectively lowered the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; maintained by&nbsp;these incumbents. The obvious effectiveness of&nbsp;that &laquo;Catalyst&raquo; is&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s market position today. Apple competitors must now find a&nbsp;new &laquo;Catalyst&raquo; which will enable them to&nbsp;accomplish the same feat.

From the list of&nbsp;competitor actions outlined above very few of&nbsp;them are likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;&laquo;Catalytic&raquo;. The one exception is&nbsp;Google&rsquo;s decision to&nbsp;use an&nbsp;open development model for its Android operating system and then to&nbsp;make that free to&nbsp;the mobile device OEMs and carriers. &laquo;Free&raquo; and &laquo;Open&raquo; are well established &laquo;Catalysts&raquo; that have proven effective in&nbsp;reducing the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; across sectors of&nbsp;the technology market. The only problem with this approach is&nbsp;then being able to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;sustainable &laquo;Equilibrium&raquo; business model once the transition from one market state to&nbsp;the other has taken place. In&nbsp;Google&rsquo;s situation they are able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this because the &laquo;Free&raquo; offer is&nbsp;underwritten by&nbsp;their very profitable digital advertising business. Clearly not all of&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s competitors can afford to&nbsp;implement that strategy.

**Implications for Microsoft&rsquo;s Tablet and Smartphone Strategies**

Its is&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;imagine that any of&nbsp;the other items in&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;competitor actions (1&minus;5) can be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;&laquo;Catalytic&raquo;. Microsoft is&nbsp;clearly hoping that items 4 & 5 will act as&nbsp;&laquo;Catalysts&raquo;. However, the lack of&nbsp;market traction for Windows Phone 7 and its new &laquo;Metro&raquo; user interface&nbsp;&mdash; and underlying operating system&nbsp;&mdash; has clearly not had a&nbsp;&laquo;Catalytic&raquo; effect in&nbsp;the smartphone market. For this reason it&nbsp;is&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;see why the result will be&nbsp;any different when the company introduces its tablet optimized version of&nbsp;Windows 8 along with its brand new touch interface.

The market has already been pretty clear that shiny new interfaces are not enough&nbsp;&mdash; on&nbsp;their own&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;overcome the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; Apple has erected around the iPad and iPhone. Of&nbsp;course the combined effect of&nbsp;items 1&minus;5 when implemented and supported by&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s vast resources will almost certainly help it&nbsp;establish a&nbsp;defensible position for Windows 8 tablets. The Windows franchise is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the three money making engines for the company so&nbsp;Microsoft can afford to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;lot more &laquo;Energy&raquo; into overcoming any obstacles in&nbsp;its way. However, without a&nbsp;&laquo;Catalyst&raquo; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;see how Microsoft will achieve the level competitive success it&nbsp;is&nbsp;clearly hoping for. Microsoft should be&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;finding that &laquo;Catalyst&raquo;

One common category of&nbsp;&laquo;Catalyst&raquo; is&nbsp;a&nbsp;step change&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;breakthrough&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;some core technology. As&nbsp;outlined above Apple leveraged the recent availability of&nbsp;&laquo;Capacitive Touch&raquo; technology to&nbsp;&laquo;Catalyze&raquo; the success of&nbsp;the iPhone, iPod Touch and then iPad. In&nbsp;the same market Nokia used the change from analog to&nbsp;digital mobile communications as a&nbsp;&laquo;Catalyst&raquo; and was highly effective at&nbsp;reducing the &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo; around companies like Motorola and Ericsson.

Microsoft already has a&nbsp;highly &laquo;Catalytic&raquo; technology breakthrough in&nbsp;its hands. The introduction of&nbsp;Kinect for XBox&nbsp;&mdash; which enables gesture based remote interaction with games&nbsp;&mdash; has revolutionized the gaming market. Kinect quickly became one of&nbsp;the fastest and best selling pieces of&nbsp;technology of&nbsp;all time. Bringing Kinect to&nbsp;the&nbsp;PC would render current touch technology redundant very quickly. If&nbsp;Microsoft integrates Kinect technology as&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard platform feature of&nbsp;Windows 8 PCs and tablets then they may very well have found the &laquo;Catalyst&raquo; needed to&nbsp;overcome iPads dominant and seemingly insurmountable &laquo;Activation Barrier&raquo;.
