We&nbsp;are currently witnessing a&nbsp;major pivot in&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s core business model. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;starting to&nbsp;become clear that&nbsp;&mdash; as&nbsp;Steve Ballmer <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar12/shareholder-letter/index.html" target="_blank">recently announced</a>&nbsp;&mdash; Microsoft is&nbsp;deadly serious about becoming a&nbsp;global leader in&nbsp;consumer &laquo;Devices and Services.&raquo; Successful execution of&nbsp;this strategy will require the company to&nbsp;control everything from manufacturing, distribution logistics through to&nbsp;retail.

The company appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;executing a 'Leader' strategy in&nbsp;the devices business which would give them even greater control than Apple famously does over the end user experience. In&nbsp;addition the company is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;repurpose its online service investments to&nbsp;add value to&nbsp;this new device-led strategy. A-la Apple, consumers will have no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;use Microsoft own services when using a&nbsp;Microsoft mobile device and competition authorities will be&nbsp;powerless to&nbsp;prevent it.

If&nbsp;correct, this pivot will has profound implications for the structure of&nbsp;the company, shareholder value and for the entire mobile technology industry.<!--more-->

##### In&nbsp;the beginning&hellip;

I&nbsp;was reminded recently by&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;former Microsoft colleagues about a&nbsp;presentation Steve Ballmer gave to&nbsp;the sales force several years ago. It&nbsp;was Steve&rsquo;s keynote at&nbsp;the annual sales meeting and it&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the more emotional presentations by&nbsp;Steve that I&nbsp;or&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the other attendees had witnessed. The theme of&nbsp;Steve&rsquo;s presentation was Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s legendary '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rumble_in_the_Jungle" target="_blank">Rumble in&nbsp;the Jungle</a>' with George Foreman. In&nbsp;his presentation Steve&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;huge sports fan&nbsp;&mdash; analogized Microsoft to&nbsp;Ali&nbsp;&mdash; an&nbsp;underdog in&nbsp;the fight of&nbsp;its life against younger, fitter and more agile competition. Ali of&nbsp;course won the fight supported by&nbsp;60,000 fans chanting &laquo;<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boom%20ba%20yay" target="_blank">Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!</a>&raquo;, &laquo;Ali Kill Him.&raquo; You can picture Steve energetically bounding around the stage screaming &laquo;Microsoft Bomaye!&raquo; getting 15,00 Microsoft sales staff wound up&nbsp;into an&nbsp;enthusiastic frenzy.

On&nbsp;face value this revving up&nbsp;of&nbsp;the sales team was vintage Ballmer, ever the master salesman himself, getting the troops pumped up&nbsp;to&nbsp;go do&nbsp;battle with the enemy. But recent conversation have caused me&nbsp;to&nbsp;suspect that there was a&nbsp;much more important hidden message. Ali did not enter the ring in&nbsp;Zaire to&nbsp;fight Foreman without a&nbsp;plan. Far from&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;fact Ali was very clear before the fight that his strategy would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;absorb all of&nbsp;Foreman&rsquo;s punishment in&nbsp;the early rounds, tire him out and then land a&nbsp;killer knockout blow. That&rsquo;s exactly what he&nbsp;did.

I&nbsp;now suspect that Steve came to&nbsp;that annual sales meeting with a&nbsp;long-term strategic plan already developed. Steve was pumped up&nbsp;because he&nbsp;realized that Microsoft would need to&nbsp;live through a&nbsp;punishing period where everyone would write-off the company, competitors would land punishing blows and eventually&nbsp;&mdash; when the time was right&nbsp;&mdash; Microsoft would&nbsp;&mdash; like Ali&nbsp;&mdash; deliver a&nbsp;knockout blow.

After years of&nbsp;punishment by&nbsp;the likes of&nbsp;Google and Apple we&nbsp;may now be&nbsp;approaching the point where&nbsp;&mdash; at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;Steve&rsquo;s view&nbsp;&mdash; Microsoft is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;land a&nbsp;killer punch.

##### Out of&nbsp;Advertising

At&nbsp;another annual sales meeting a&nbsp;few years after &laquo;Microsoft Boomaye!&raquo; my&nbsp;team met with Steve to&nbsp;discuss a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;technology policy challenges we&nbsp;were facing. We&nbsp;felt there was an&nbsp;opportunity for Microsoft to&nbsp;take the high-ground on&nbsp;personal data privacy issues as&nbsp;a&nbsp;competitive position against Google. Steve agreed that this was clearly an&nbsp;opportunity but while sympathetic to&nbsp;taking that position he&nbsp;was not yet ready to&nbsp;support&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;felt that putting a&nbsp;stake in&nbsp;the ground at&nbsp;this stage would be&nbsp;premature. Once the company committed to&nbsp;a&nbsp;policy position it&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;stick with that position. Steve felt that putting a&nbsp;stake in&nbsp;the ground on&nbsp;consumer privacy before the online advertising market had matured might unnecessarily limit the company&rsquo;s future options.

Three recent announcements clearly indicate that Microsoft is&nbsp;now ready to&nbsp;put that stake in&nbsp;the ground and that the company&rsquo;s experiment with an&nbsp;independently targeted advertising based revenue model is&nbsp;over.

The company&rsquo;s write-off of&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/global-cio/roi/microsoft-ad-business-in-doubt-after-62/240003140" target="_blank">$6,2 Billion investment in&nbsp;aQuantive</a> was the first indicator. Microsoft made than investment as&nbsp;a&nbsp;competitive bulwark against Google and now its being written off. In&nbsp;effect the online advertising business&nbsp;&mdash; at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;its current form&nbsp;&mdash; has been judged to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;core to&nbsp;Microsoft long-term strategic success. This not to&nbsp;say that the company will withdraw from the advertising business altogether but I&nbsp;believe Steve and Co. have a&nbsp;different and more focused model in&nbsp;mind.

Microsoft&rsquo;s May 2012 announcement that the next version of&nbsp;Internet Explorer would enable &laquo;Do&nbsp;Not Track&raquo; by&nbsp;default has caused [outrage across the advertiser community](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232036/Ad_industry_calls_IE10_s_Do_Not_Track_setting_unacceptable_). That is&nbsp;certainly one very large and very clearly marked stake in&nbsp;the ground. In&nbsp;the most direct way it&nbsp;can Microsoft is&nbsp;saying to&nbsp;advertisers that they are no-longer perceived as&nbsp;important to&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s long-term success.

Finally, The company&rsquo;s announcement this Monday (October 22nd 2012)&nbsp;&mdash; clarifying that it&nbsp;will [not use consumers personal data for targeted advertising](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3542642/microsoft-clarifies-policy-personal-information)&mdash;&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;final nail in&nbsp;the coffin for the once imagined head-to-head battle with Google for advertiser&rsquo;s dollars. That game is&nbsp;over and Microsoft is&nbsp;moving on&nbsp;with what it&nbsp;believes is&nbsp;a&nbsp;far more compelling advertising augmented revenue strategy.

##### Into Devices

Steve Ballmer&rsquo;s [recent announcement](http://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar12/shareholder-letter/index.html) that Microsoft should now be&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;&laquo;[Devices and Software](http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-ceo-ballmer-devices-devices-devices-7000005507/)&raquo; company was met with derision by&nbsp;the digerati and commentariat. The company&rsquo;s track record in&nbsp;devices&nbsp;&mdash; beyond keyboards, mice and the XBox&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;lamentable. Zune players anyone? Even XBox&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;huge success by&nbsp;any criteria&nbsp;&mdash; had its share of [manufacturing problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems) which have not exactly burnished Microsoft&rsquo;s hardware credentials. But what if&nbsp;everything to&nbsp;date was&nbsp;&mdash; as&nbsp;they say&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;learning opportunity?

It&nbsp;famously takes three version for any Microsoft product to&nbsp;reach its full potential. Its quite possible that version three of&nbsp;&laquo;Microsoft as&nbsp;a&nbsp;device manufacturer&raquo; is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unleashed on&nbsp;the world. The evidence for this can be&nbsp;pieced together from a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;moves over recent years. Apple&rsquo;s [acquisition of&nbsp;Intrinsity](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/technology/28apple.html?_r=0)&nbsp;&mdash; an&nbsp;ARM processor design company&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;2010 generated a&nbsp;huge amount of&nbsp;commentary but&nbsp;&mdash; strategically&nbsp;&mdash; not such a&nbsp;surprising move by&nbsp;a&nbsp;hardware company. What might be&nbsp;more surprising is&nbsp;knowing that Microsoft established a&nbsp;Silicon Architectures &laquo;SiArch&raquo; team long before Apple got into that business and has been [hiring some top chip design talent](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/what-is-microsoft-siarch-and-why-did-they-hire-a-sun-chip-guy/2477).

In&nbsp;July 2010 Microsoft [signed a&nbsp;new &laquo;Architecture&raquo; license with ARM](http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/microsoft-licenses-arm-architecture.php). This license gives Microsoft the rights to&nbsp;design its own processors based on&nbsp;the ARM architecture. Just the sort of&nbsp;thing you would need if&nbsp;&mdash; like apple&nbsp;&mdash; you want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in the business of&nbsp;creating differentiated processor capability for your own range of&nbsp;devices.

This week saw the <a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/rumor-microsoft-built-its-own-factory-to-produce-surface-tablets/" target="_blank">publication of&nbsp;a&nbsp;story</a> claiming that Microsoft was manufacturing the new surface tablets in&nbsp;its own manufacturing facility in&nbsp;China. The tenuous nature of&nbsp;the sourcing for this story lead many to&nbsp;question its validity. I&rsquo;m surprised by&nbsp;that reaction because [Microsoft confirmed](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/correct-microsoft-factory-in-china-to-make-new-zunes) that they has dedicated manufacturing capabilities back in&nbsp;2007.

From what I&nbsp;can piece together I&nbsp;suspect the company&rsquo;s manufacturing capability has advanced significantly over the last five years. It&nbsp;would not surprise me&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn that Microsoft has invested in&nbsp;the level of&nbsp;massive dedicated manufacturing capability that would enable it&nbsp;to&nbsp;compete as&nbsp;a&nbsp;global device manufacturer. Anything less than that would be a 'follower' strategy and I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t think the Microsoft leadership team see themselves as&nbsp;followers.

I&nbsp;believe that the pivot towards a&nbsp;&laquo;Devices and Services&raquo; business strategy is&nbsp;premised on&nbsp;the company becoming a&nbsp;category leader, not a&nbsp;follower. If&nbsp;that is&nbsp;the case then they would want to&nbsp;have much more control over supply chain and distribution logistics than even Apple achieves. Instead of&nbsp;merely assembling components a&nbsp;truly agressive 'Leader' strategy would have the company moving upstream into component production. We&nbsp;already know that the company has the ability to&nbsp;create custom processor designs. Are those really nice surface tablet displays also designed and perhaps even manufactured in&nbsp;house?

##### Becoming A&nbsp;Consumer Business

I&nbsp;have been a&nbsp;long and constant critic of&nbsp;the Microsoft management team for their lack of&nbsp;focus and obsession with becoming a&nbsp;consumer company. I&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;the first to&nbsp;suggest that&nbsp;&mdash; over the last 10 years&nbsp;&mdash; Microsoft has become the 'Rodney Dangerfield' of&nbsp;the technology industry: Unable to&nbsp;get respect from anyone.

The reality is&nbsp;that by&nbsp;revenue and profitability measures alone Microsoft is&nbsp;quite clearly an&nbsp;enterprise software company&nbsp;&mdash; not a&nbsp;consumer products company. The evidence presented indicates that the company maybe getting ready to&nbsp;finally bring clarity to&nbsp;its schizoid business model with a&nbsp;massive pivot towards a&nbsp;&laquo;Devices and Service&raquo; consumer facing business model. That pivot would require very significant investments in&nbsp;an&nbsp;end-to-end value chain.

We&nbsp;know that Microsoft has device design and manufacturing capability. We&nbsp;also know that the company has invested in&nbsp;its own retail presence over the last few years. That was viewed as&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;mimic Apple. But what if&nbsp;this retail strategy had always been about creating a&nbsp;storefront for the company&rsquo;s own manufactured devices. Such a&nbsp;strategy would allow Microsoft to&nbsp;by-pass traditional low-rent&nbsp;&mdash; but margin eating&nbsp;&mdash; outlets such as&nbsp;Best Buy.

If&nbsp;the company is&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;end-to-end device manufacturer then the retail strategy takes on&nbsp;a&nbsp;much larger significance. With in-house manufacturing capability at&nbsp;one and and retail distribution at&nbsp;the other Microsoft would need to&nbsp;join the two. A 'Leader' strategy would require the company to&nbsp;take far greater control of&nbsp;distribution logistics. A 'Leader' would not sub-contract logistics to&nbsp;a&nbsp;3rd party but rather would build an&nbsp;end-to-end managed distribution network from manufacture to&nbsp;consumer hands.

If&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;taking control of&nbsp;its own distribution network then hiring of&nbsp;Kevin Turner&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;former senior WalMart executive&nbsp;&mdash; makes a&nbsp;lot more sense. Turner was viewed as a 'square peg in&nbsp;a&nbsp;round hole' overseeing Microsoft&rsquo;s&nbsp;&mdash; core&nbsp;&mdash; enterprise sales business. During my&nbsp;time with the company Turner was widely disliked by&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s enterprise sales staff and was viewed as 'Not getting it' or&nbsp;understanding what was required to&nbsp;meet enterprise customer&rsquo;s expectations.

What Turner does understand&nbsp;&mdash; from his years at&nbsp;WalMart&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;consumer retail and supply chain management. These are just the skills to&nbsp;have on&nbsp;hand if&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;pivot it&rsquo;s business model towards a&nbsp;consumer &laquo;Devices and Services&raquo; company.

##### Serving The Device

Microsoft&rsquo;s moves to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;stake in&nbsp;the ground regarding online consumer data protection change the company&rsquo;s calculus about advertising as&nbsp;an&nbsp;intrinsic revenue stream.

The company clearly sees an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;put Google on&nbsp;the back-foot. Microsoft can position itself a&nbsp;champion of&nbsp;consumer data protection and rights while placing Google in&nbsp;the uncomfortable position of&nbsp;either defending its agressive monetization of&nbsp;consumer data or&nbsp;backing away from its current business strategy. Neither of&nbsp;those are palatable outcomes for Google and the latter is&nbsp;certainly untenable given how dependent Google is&nbsp;on&nbsp;it&rsquo;s advertising revenue stream.

To&nbsp;say that Microsoft has not performed in&nbsp;online consumer services would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;gross understatement. Bilions and billions and billions of&nbsp;dollars have been invested over many years with the company gaining almost zero traction in&nbsp;any meaningful service category. The investment in&nbsp;Bing search and the partnership with Yahoo have hardly yielded the type of&nbsp;market redefining results both company&rsquo;s had hoped for. If&nbsp;the company is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;pivoting its business model towards a&nbsp;consumer devices-led strategy then expect the company&rsquo;s online services to&nbsp;be&nbsp;re-focused and re-purposed to&nbsp;that end.

Under this new device-led strategy online services would become value enhancers for devices rather than stand-alone businesses in&nbsp;their own right. Today services like Bing have to&nbsp;compete in&nbsp;an&nbsp;open market where consumers have choice. When a&nbsp;consumer is&nbsp;using a&nbsp;Surface device then the only search, maps or&nbsp;music service they will have access to&nbsp;will be&nbsp;those provided by&nbsp;Microsoft.

Microsoft has had its fair share of&nbsp;anti-trust problems with both the United States Department of&nbsp;Justice and with The European Commissions Competition authorities. In&nbsp;each case Microsoft was judged to&nbsp;have mis-used its monopoly position in&nbsp;the market for&nbsp;PC operating systems. No&nbsp;such claims will be&nbsp;possible against the company when it&nbsp;enters the device business for two reasons. Firstly, Apple and Google already dominate the market for mobile devices. Microsoft quite clearly would not have a&nbsp;monopoly to&nbsp;abuse. In&nbsp;addition Microsoft has rather cleverly cleaved its operating system strategy.

Win8-RT is&nbsp;an&nbsp;entirely different operating system from classic Windows. If&nbsp;Microsoft ties its own services to&nbsp;Win8-RT then competiton authorities are going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;hard time make any abuse of&nbsp;monopoly case stick.

##### Wither the OEMs

In a [recent article](http://www.adamalthus.com/blog/2012/07/11/why-microsoft-shareholders-should-be-very-concerned/) I&nbsp;concluded that Microsoft&rsquo;s ambitions to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an true consumer products company would remain an&nbsp;expensive fantasy until Steve and the management team were willing to&nbsp;&laquo;Throw the OEM part­ner com­mu­nity under the bus.&raquo; It&nbsp;now appears that the company is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;do&nbsp;just that.

Microsoft&rsquo;s public pronouncements about the importance of&nbsp;the OEM in&nbsp;the wake of&nbsp;the release of&nbsp;Surface are more than a&nbsp;little disingenuous. Microsoft finally does appear to&nbsp;have crossed the rubicon in&nbsp;regards to&nbsp;the long-term value of&nbsp;their OEM partners. The company appears to&nbsp;embarking on&nbsp;a&nbsp;strategy that&nbsp;&mdash; while accommodating the OEM channel&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;throw them a&nbsp;life raft. OEMs who do&nbsp;not already have an&nbsp;alternative business strategy when Microsoft becomes their largest and most agressive competitor are in&nbsp;deep trouble.

Ironically the OEM channel is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;commit collective suicide by&nbsp;enabling Microsoft to&nbsp;become their executioner.

Microsoft desperately needs the OEMs right now. They are needed because that&rsquo;s the only way to&nbsp;get Windows 8 into the hands of&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;consumers. But&nbsp;&mdash; wittingly or&nbsp;unwittingly&nbsp;&mdash; the OEMs are acting as&nbsp;the vector for the &laquo;Virus&raquo; that will ultimately kill them off. Once a&nbsp;critical mass of&nbsp;consumers have become hooked on&nbsp;Windows 8 Microsoft will have established the reach and credibility of&nbsp;the operating system that is&nbsp;required to&nbsp;execute the company&rsquo;s devices strategy.

Once Microsoft has its own volume device capability it&nbsp;will have no&nbsp;strategic need for the OEM channel. Microsoft&rsquo;s message to&nbsp;the OEMs can be&nbsp;summed up&nbsp;as&nbsp;&laquo;Enjoy the ride while it&nbsp;lasts.&raquo;

##### Nok Nok&hellip;

Perhaps the company most likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;impacted by&nbsp;Microsoft consumer devices strategy is&nbsp;Nokia. I&nbsp;have absolutely no&nbsp;doubt that Microsoft is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;manufacturer of&nbsp;a&nbsp;full range of&nbsp;Windows 8 based smartphones. That is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;happen sooner rather than later. When Microsoft launches a 'Surface Phone' it&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite simply game over for Nokia.

Consumers already have a&nbsp;hard time choosing betweens phones running Windows Phone 7 and competing offers from Apple and the Android OEMs. If&nbsp;Microsoft comes to&nbsp;market with a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;world-class devices running Windows 8 and sells them through its own retail channel then I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t see much opportunity for Nokia - or&nbsp;any other Win8 phone OEM for that matter.

Nokia&rsquo;s strategic options are shrinking rapidly. It&rsquo;s my&nbsp;view that when Microsoft enters the phone business with its own devices Nokia will have run out of&nbsp;time as&nbsp;an&nbsp;independent company. The most likely final chapter in&nbsp;its storied history sees Microsoft buying up&nbsp;Nokia&rsquo;s sizable patent portfolio, its in-house design and engineering expertise and&nbsp;&mdash; perhaps&nbsp;&mdash; the brand rights. Perhaps Nokia&rsquo;s CEO Stephen Elop will even rejoin the Microsoft leadership team to&nbsp;run the phone business. Alternatives to&nbsp;this outcome seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very few and far between.

Truly a&nbsp;sad end to&nbsp;a&nbsp;once dominant company.

##### Two&nbsp;OS to&nbsp;Rule Them All?

Can Microsoft maintain its current corporate structure if&nbsp;it&nbsp;successfully pivots its business model to&nbsp;become the leading devices and services company? I&nbsp;suspect not.

Successfully executing on&nbsp;the strategy outlined in&nbsp;this article would clearly give Microsoft a&nbsp;new lease on&nbsp;life. On&nbsp;growth prospects alone you would want to&nbsp;own the stock. However, effecting this level of&nbsp;radical change in&nbsp;strategy would amplify&nbsp;&mdash; rather than mitigate&nbsp;&mdash; the schizoid nature of&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s operating model. Microsoft would become a&nbsp;company of&nbsp;two polar opposites: A&nbsp;defined, successful and moderate growth enterprise software company at&nbsp;one extreme and a&nbsp;very high growth devices-led consumer business at&nbsp;the other. A&nbsp;single stock ticker representing two such radically different business models makes little sense.

One of&nbsp;the many strategic issues posed when considering splitting up&nbsp;Microsoft has always been 'What to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the Windows business.' It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;relatively trivial exercise to&nbsp;bucket Microsoft&rsquo;s business divisions into either the enterprise or&nbsp;consumer category. But the Windows division quite clearly serves both. If&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;split the company up&nbsp;then where would the Windows division end up?

The problem of&nbsp;where to&nbsp;put the Windows division would be&nbsp;made a&nbsp;lot easier if&nbsp;Microsoft had two operating systems, one consumer focused and the other designed for the enterprise. This realization puts a&nbsp;whole new spin on&nbsp;the Windows 8 strategy.

There are two versions of&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;&mdash; one a&nbsp;direct descendant of&nbsp;Windows 7 designed for the Intel architecture and a&nbsp;second brand new 'RT' - version designed for ARM based devices. Initially this looked to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;retrograde step. The company spent years and billions of&nbsp;dollars trying to&nbsp;collapse it&rsquo;s complex operating system portfolio down to&nbsp;single re-usable Windows code base. Now the company has gone in&nbsp;the opposite direction. Microsoft now has two versions of&nbsp;Windows; one enterprise focused and one purposefully designed for consumer devices.

Breaking the company up&nbsp;into independent consumer and enterprise focused entities would drive huge clarity and focus and unlock a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;shareholder value. Having two distinct versions of&nbsp;Windows 8 aligned to&nbsp;each segment just made that a&nbsp;lot more straightforward.

##### Evidence and Supposition

Whether Steve and the leadership team ever decide that Microsoft and its shareholders would be&nbsp;better served by&nbsp;a&nbsp;managed breakup of&nbsp;the company remains to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen. What is&nbsp;clear from recent evidence is&nbsp;that the company is&nbsp;embarking on&nbsp;the biggest change in&nbsp;business strategy in&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s history. Their ambition is&nbsp;no&nbsp;less than to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;global leader in&nbsp;consumer devices and services.

Microsoft&rsquo;s leadership team understands that the only way to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful with this strategy is&nbsp;to&nbsp;take control of&nbsp;the entire end-to-end value chain and to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so in&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper way than even Apple has achieved. Such a&nbsp;radical strategy would give Microsoft significant margin advantages over its competitors and would enable it&nbsp;to&nbsp;take complete control over the end consumer experience&nbsp;&mdash; something it&nbsp;has desperately lacked in&nbsp;its battle with Apple.

The re-alignment of&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s online services as&nbsp;value enhancers for a&nbsp;device-led strategy will also bring much needed focus to&nbsp;those investments and in&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;would enable Microsoft to&nbsp;take the high-ground on&nbsp;consumer privacy in&nbsp;their battle with Google.

If&nbsp;Microsoft pull this off then the consumer technology business&nbsp;&mdash; and the company&rsquo;s stock&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;in&nbsp;for a&nbsp;wild ride.
