In&nbsp;ten years we&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;recognize this week as&nbsp;the moment Intel ceded its leadership position in&nbsp;the global chip business. Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to&nbsp;embrace ARM signaled more than a&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s iPad&nbsp;&mdash; we&nbsp;are witnessing the end of&nbsp;the 'WinTel' era and the emergence of 'ARMDows' - a&nbsp;seismic shift in&nbsp;the&nbsp;IT industry is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;take place.<!--more-->

Intel and Microsoft are like a&nbsp;married couple who can&rsquo;t stand the sight of&nbsp;each other and yet whose fortunes are so&nbsp;intertwined that they cannot afford to&nbsp;get divorced. Despite what you may read in&nbsp;the press releases there&rsquo;s no&nbsp;love lost between the management teams of&nbsp;the two companies. Rather the opposite might be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;the truth. Both have been seeking a&nbsp;way out of&nbsp;their co-dependency but the urgency has been greater for Intel.

Chip making is&nbsp;a&nbsp;commodity business. The _only_ thing that matters is&nbsp;performance and price per watt i.e. how cheaply can they provide the most performance with the lowest energy consumption. That reality is&nbsp;borne out by&nbsp;the dizzying roster of&nbsp;processors Intel produces. Each is&nbsp;uniquely 'tuned' by&nbsp;the marketing department to&nbsp;target a&nbsp;very specific economic demographics of&nbsp;the computer buying public.

Intel&rsquo;s constant nightmare is&nbsp;the relentless path to&nbsp;commoditization for x86 architecture processors. The pressures created by&nbsp;AMD in&nbsp;this regard lead to&nbsp;behavior which the European Commission&rsquo;s competition authority deemed to&nbsp;have &laquo;diminished competitors' ability to&nbsp;compete on&nbsp;the merits of&nbsp;their x86 CPUs.&raquo; In&nbsp;desperate circumstances, companies some times resort to&nbsp;desperate measures.

Intel&rsquo;s dreams came true when it&nbsp;started playing around with Linux. Here at&nbsp;last was the perfect partner; no&nbsp;one really controlled Linux. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;molded to&nbsp;Intel&rsquo;s needs and would finally offer the opportunity to&nbsp;escape Microsoft&rsquo;s cold embrace. To&nbsp;say that Intel&rsquo;s increasing infatuation with Linux didn&rsquo;t go&nbsp;down well in&nbsp;Redmond would be&nbsp;like saying the gulf oil spill was a&nbsp;small leak.

The day Intel announced their engagement with Linux was the day SteveB and the boys in&nbsp;Redmond started working on&nbsp;the divorce paperwork. At&nbsp;CES in&nbsp;Las Vegas this week the writ was served.

The ARM architecture can now be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;over 90% of&nbsp;all mobile phones. It&nbsp;powers the iPad the fastest selling computing device of&nbsp;all time and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;now about to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;very direct alternative to&nbsp;Intel chips powering hundred of&nbsp;millions, if&nbsp;not billions of&nbsp;devices which will run Windows.

Microsoft&rsquo;s ability to&nbsp;craft a&nbsp;compelling response to&nbsp;iPad and the emerging tablet market in&nbsp;general still remains very much in&nbsp;question but that was not the most important issue at&nbsp;play in&nbsp;this week&rsquo;s announcements. Intel has already been written off in&nbsp;the low margin, low power, high volume, internet connected device market. Despite being demonstrably unable to&nbsp;curb the ARM architecture&rsquo;s growing dominance of&nbsp;this market this is&nbsp;not&nbsp;&mdash; I&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;&mdash; what keeps Intel&rsquo;s senior leadership team up&nbsp;at&nbsp;night.

The very profitable end of&nbsp;Intel&rsquo;s business comes from another domain altogether; servers. The inexorable growth in&nbsp;demand for more and more server computing capacity enables Intel to&nbsp;charge a&nbsp;huge and profitable premium for their high end&nbsp;&mdash; server targeted&nbsp;&mdash; processors. For the last 10 years, Intel have had almost zero competition in&nbsp;this market killing off competitors&nbsp;&mdash; like Sun&rsquo;s Sparc and IBM Power series&nbsp;&mdash; by&nbsp;leveraging very compelling volume economics and&nbsp;&mdash; most importantly&nbsp;&mdash; by&nbsp;riding Microsoft&rsquo;s growth in&nbsp;the enterprise software business.

The scale economics of&nbsp;the WinTel platform&nbsp;&mdash; Intel processors and Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Server stack&nbsp;&mdash; has decimated competition and established the dominant regime to&nbsp;be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;most data-centers around the world today. IDC&rsquo;s server numbers&nbsp;&mdash; the most respected for this type of&nbsp;data -make the point. In&nbsp;December last year IDC <a href="http://www.idc.com/about/viewpressrelease.jsp?containerId=prUS22592710&sectionId=null&elementId=null&pageType=SYNOPSIS" target="_blank">published</a> their third quarter server market share numbers&nbsp;&mdash; Intel servers running Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Server operating system accounted for 47.7% of&nbsp;overall quarterly shipped factory revenue. The nearest competitor was Linux based Intel servers with 17.5% of&nbsp;overall revenue.

What seems to&nbsp;have been lost in&nbsp;this week&rsquo;s Microsoft and ARM announcement is&nbsp;the implications for the server business. As&nbsp;this BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12133770" target="_blank">report</a> points out, ARM have been quietly working away at&nbsp;an&nbsp;optimized processor design for server applications for the last last eighteen months. You can bet that the Windows Sever team is&nbsp;now very engaged in&nbsp;that development process. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view, we&rsquo;re about to&nbsp;witness a&nbsp;fundamental transformation of&nbsp;the server business and it&nbsp;looks like Microsoft has just lined itself up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be the prime beneficiary. As&nbsp;ARM boss Warren East points out in&nbsp;the BBC report &laquo;They [Microsoft] are ambitious to&nbsp;put that operating system everywhere &hellip; It&nbsp;works for both of&nbsp;us.&raquo;

Over the next ten years we&nbsp;will witness a&nbsp;massive relocation of&nbsp;compute capacity out of&nbsp;private corporate data-centers into high density cloud compute facilities. In&nbsp;ten years time it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very unlikely that any CIO will want to&nbsp;carry the cost, risk and complexity of&nbsp;running their own server farms. Cloud computing will become the utility&nbsp;IT service provider of&nbsp;choice. As&nbsp;this transformation moves forward old Intel servers will be&nbsp;retired from traditional data centers while a&nbsp;new generation of&nbsp;low power, highly efficient&nbsp;&mdash; ARM based&nbsp;&mdash; servers will come online in&nbsp;the cloud and&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s view of&nbsp;the world&nbsp;&mdash; the majority of&nbsp;them running some version of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Microsoft operating system&nbsp;&mdash; Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure Cloud stack is&nbsp;after-all just a&nbsp;tuned version of&nbsp;Windows Server with some very clever and innovative management software running on&nbsp;top.

These market dynamics combine to&nbsp;become Intel&rsquo;s worst nightmare; a&nbsp;classic market squeeze between multiple ultra-high volume, low margin providers of&nbsp;ARM based processors at&nbsp;the low end and a&nbsp;compelling ARM based value proposition&nbsp;&mdash; based on&nbsp;efficiency and low operating costs on&nbsp;the very high end. Intel ends up&nbsp;with what is&nbsp;left of&nbsp;the so-so traditional&nbsp;PC middle market. Even that gets increasingly cannibalized by&nbsp;ever more powerful and capable low end devices. Ultimately Intel neither commands the volumes or&nbsp;the high-end margins required to&nbsp;sustain the R&D expenditures needed to&nbsp;stay ahead and the inevitable downward spiral becomes inescapable.

Of&nbsp;course Intel&rsquo;s management is&nbsp;far from being unaware of&nbsp;these strategic challenges and with their formidable resources you can expect them try their hardest to&nbsp;compete and innovate their way around this challenge. They need to&nbsp;because the very future of&nbsp;Intel will depend on&nbsp;it.
