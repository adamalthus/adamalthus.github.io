Over the last couple of&nbsp;weeks I&rsquo;ve presented a&nbsp;more forward looking view of&nbsp;what lies beyond our current conception of&nbsp;cloud computing at <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-3rd-Era-Enabling-A-Composable-Future-Final.pdf" target="_blank">CloudConnect in&nbsp;Las Vegas</a>, a <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Beyond-Cloud.pdf" target="_blank">research symposium at&nbsp;UC Berkeley</a> and to&nbsp;the Northern California chapter of&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Beyond-Cloud1.pdf" target="_blank">Young Presidents Organization</a>. I&rsquo;ve used these presentations to&nbsp;outline an&nbsp;evolving set of&nbsp;ideas anchored around the idea that we&rsquo;re in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 2nd Era of&nbsp;Computing rapidly evolving towards the 3rd Era. The organizing principle behind the 'Era' concept is&nbsp;the degree of&nbsp;coupling in&nbsp;and between application code and the underlying infrastructure. <!--more-->

During the 1st Era of&nbsp;Computing applications were tightly coupled to&nbsp;underlying hardware in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;optimize the use of&nbsp;scarce and expensive computing resources. The 2nd Era in&nbsp;which we&nbsp;now find ourselves requires loosely coupled architectures to&nbsp;enable resilient, elastic and composable, cloud scale application and service workloads. However, the coming data volume and management demands of&nbsp;trillions of&nbsp;connected devices&nbsp;&mdash; the Internet of&nbsp;Things&nbsp;&mdash; combined with the need for truly friction free machine-2-machine transactions will rapidly drive the emergence of&nbsp;the 3rd Era of&nbsp;Computing. In&nbsp;the 3rd Era we&nbsp;will move from loosely coupled of&nbsp;truly uncoupled architectures where code is&nbsp;free to&nbsp;execute when and where it&nbsp;is&nbsp;needed enabled by&nbsp;a&nbsp;new fabric of&nbsp;trusted, frictionless, smart contract based transactions.
