Watching the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13665140" target="_blank">news coming out of&nbsp;Greece</a> over the weekend reminded me&nbsp;of&nbsp;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999%E2%80%932002)" target="_blank">economic crisis in&nbsp;Argentina in&nbsp;2001</a>. Growing public unrest, a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;military intervention and an&nbsp;seemingly irresolvable economic crisis are all common factors but Argentina stands as&nbsp;a&nbsp;defining example of&nbsp;why it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t always pay to&nbsp;follow the advice of&nbsp;the IMF.

Looking at&nbsp;the growth of&nbsp;the Argentinian economy today its hard to&nbsp;argue that they chose the wrong path. This should worry the heck out of&nbsp;Euro policy makers. Its seems very far fetched to&nbsp;imagine a&nbsp;world where Greece exits from the Euro but growing public pressure and a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;political consensus behind the austerity measures being proposed make this option more likely every day. I&nbsp;think Moody&rsquo;s recent evaluation that there&rsquo;s now a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/02/greece-50percent-chance-default" target="_blank">50:50 probability of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Creek debt default</a> is&nbsp;probably right on&nbsp;the money.
