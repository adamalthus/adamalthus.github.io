Exponential growth in&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;information technology enhanced by&nbsp;Internet driven network effects mean that even the most mundane manufactured products are seen as&nbsp;just one component of&nbsp;a&nbsp;broader digital services based value chain.

The shift to&nbsp;digital services has transformed the global competitive landscape. Maintaining competitive differentiation requires continuous innovation&nbsp;&mdash; and lifecycles are contracting. In&nbsp;other words change is&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant.

The dynamics of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hyper-competitive global market mean that static and long-lived models of&nbsp;company structure, operations and information technology services are no&nbsp;longer fit for purpose. We&nbsp;need a&nbsp;new operating model for the enterprise.

<!--more-->

It&nbsp;is a&nbsp;reality of&nbsp;business today that supplier relationships, logistics networks, product and service design and customer service all survives in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;permanent flux. Any path to&nbsp;sustainable competitive advantage will require a&nbsp;high degree of&nbsp;operational adaptability.

Business functions, processes, organizations, supplier relationships and technology need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;building blocks that can be&nbsp;re-configured as&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;address changing competitive landscape.

This new _Component Operating Model_ (COM) requires a 'Lego Brick' approach to&nbsp;designing and implementing processes and the organizations that support them. Implementing a _COM_ based approach will have profound impacts on&nbsp;the structure of&nbsp;organizations, the nature of&nbsp;work.

Business designs based on _COM_ will create significant stress for traditional&nbsp;IT infrastructures and organizations. Our current&nbsp;IT services were built to&nbsp;serve a&nbsp;static&nbsp;&mdash; and often functionally silo&rsquo;d&nbsp;&mdash; operating model. IT&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;become much more dynamically adaptable to&nbsp;keep pace with the speed of&nbsp;business today.

A&nbsp;new _Component Architecture Model_ (CAM) approach to&nbsp;IT infrastructure, applications and services will be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;ensure that&nbsp;IT can deliver what the business needs. The time between identifying a&nbsp;business need and delivering the required&nbsp;IT solution needs to&nbsp;becomes hours and days rather than months and years.

The ‘Ying and Yang' of _COM_ and _CAM_ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;radical departure from the discontinuities of&nbsp;the past. We&nbsp;are about to&nbsp;enter an&nbsp;era where&nbsp;&mdash; for the first time&nbsp;&mdash; business and technology operating models can be&nbsp;seamlessly aligned to&nbsp;enable fast, flexible response to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rapidly changing competitive landscapes.

Combining the approaches of&nbsp;both _COM_ and _CAM_ will enable us&nbsp;to&nbsp;view the entire portfolio of&nbsp;business functions, processes, organizations, relationships and technology as&nbsp;a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;re-usable components that can be&nbsp;configured as&nbsp;demanded.

Welcome to&nbsp;the _Composable Enterprise&trade;_.

# Radical Change

Most companies would consider the _Composable Enterprise Model&trade;_ (CEM) __radical today. And yet its difficult to&nbsp;imagine how more static approaches to&nbsp;business operations will survive in&nbsp;an&nbsp;increasingly dynamic and competitive global economy.

A ‘chasm' already exists between those companies that grew-up-digital and those more traditional companies attempting to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;new digital markets.

Companies such as&nbsp;Amazon have always had to&nbsp;deal with hyper-competition and constant, fast-cycle change. Amazon&rsquo;s approach to&nbsp;building out its retail business is&nbsp;driven by&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep understanding of&nbsp;digital business dynamics. Amazon is&nbsp;perhaps the closest proxy for a _Composable Enterprise&trade;_ today and that makes it&nbsp;a&nbsp;formidable competitor for traditional ‘Bricks and Mortar' retailers.

Building a _Composable Enterprise&trade;_ operating model&nbsp;&mdash; where functions and processes can be&nbsp;continually re-configured with low cost and operational impact&nbsp;&mdash; raises significant challenges. The two greatest of&nbsp;these will undoubtedly be&nbsp;organization and technology. This is&nbsp;change management in&nbsp;extremis.

Change of&nbsp;this magnitude requires visionary and forceful top-down leadership. Implementing the _Composable Enterprise_ approach is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;happen from the bottom-up. The level of&nbsp;disruption in&nbsp;most organizations will require a&nbsp;vision to&nbsp;which staff can aspire. The greater the change the more compelling that vision will need to&nbsp;be.

Companies are unlikely to&nbsp;find that they have a&nbsp;large proportion of&nbsp;staff with the skills and capability to&nbsp;build, operate and thrive in&nbsp;the _Composable Enterprise&trade;_ model. Significant re-skilling will be&nbsp;required.

Many already-digital businesses are likely to&nbsp;find that the demands placed on&nbsp;IT by&nbsp;the _Composable Enterprise&trade;_ model __far exceed the capabilities of&nbsp;existing systems and application landscapes. This will be&nbsp;amplified for company&rsquo;s attempting to&nbsp;transform from more traditional ‘analog' business models.

The vast majority of&nbsp;IT systems in&nbsp;existence were designed for static business models and not for fast re-configuration of&nbsp;business processes, data flows and interconnection between disparate functions. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;will describe below the radical _CEM_ based approach will require a&nbsp;radical technology fabric to&nbsp;match.

# The Component Organization Model

Successful re-configuration of&nbsp;a&nbsp;company&rsquo;s organization and processes to&nbsp;support the _Composable Enterprise_ approach will require a&nbsp;radical departure from historic models of&nbsp;organization and process design.

The new _Component Operating Model_ approach requires us&nbsp;to&nbsp;break processes and the organizations that manage them into their most fundamental building blocks. _COM_ is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the following key design principles that aim to&nbsp;maximize adaptability and the speed with which new processes can be&nbsp;configured and enhanced.

_The Minimal Function&nbsp;&mdash;_ Compound business processes are broken down into the minimized set of 'atomic' functions. Each function can accomplish some aspect of&nbsp;the process independently of&nbsp;other functions and consists of&nbsp;the smallest organization possible to&nbsp;accomplish the function. The purpose of&nbsp;this principle is&nbsp;to&nbsp;ensure that individual functions can be&nbsp;improved or&nbsp;replaced while minimizing impact to&nbsp;the wider organization and business process.

_Least Dependency_&nbsp;&mdash; Individual business functions should be&nbsp;designed to&nbsp;minimize dependency on&nbsp;any other function. This principle ensures that failures in&nbsp;a&nbsp;single function do&nbsp;not bring the entire process to&nbsp;a&nbsp;halt. Process steps such as&nbsp;authorizations should be&nbsp;asynchronous to&nbsp;avoid creating serial dependencies.

_Shared Knowledge&nbsp;&mdash;_ Knowledge (Data, information and context) is&nbsp;a&nbsp;resource shared across all functions. Data governance and security policies should be&nbsp;designed to&nbsp;maximize safe access to&nbsp;data to&nbsp;the broadest audience. Functions are prohibited from maintaining 'Private' data sets. The holding and protection of ‘private' knowledge is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the key barriers to&nbsp;organizational agility. When knowledge is&nbsp;not openly shared then individual functions can create dependencies on&nbsp;their existence even when that is&nbsp;not optimal for the overall business.

_Predictable Contracts&nbsp;&mdash;_ Each function defines the information and authorizations it&nbsp;requires, what work product will be&nbsp;output and provides quantified performance guarantees. This approach aims to&nbsp;minimize the governance and supervisory overhead that are often layered into organizations to&nbsp;overcome a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;predictability and performance between business functions.

_Maximized Human Value_&nbsp;&mdash; Human resource should be&nbsp;applied only to&nbsp;those tasks that cannot be&nbsp;automated: Front-line customer/partner engagement and service and where insight, analysis and qualitative decision making is&nbsp;required etc. This approach has two payoffs. It&nbsp;minimizes overall human resource expense and maximizes the value of&nbsp;roles in&nbsp;the business leading to&nbsp;higher job satisfaction and lower attrition.

We&nbsp;do&nbsp;not yet delve into appropriate governance approaches for _COM_ but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear that ‘Kanban' would be&nbsp;the most effective approach to&nbsp;overall process control in&nbsp;the _Composed Enterprise&trade;_ operating model. A ‘Pull-through' demand-forecasting approach should maximize the efficiency of&nbsp;the overall production process.

What is&nbsp;truly radical about _CEM_ is&nbsp;&mdash; finally&nbsp;&mdash; for there to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an intimate and fully aligned relationship between business and&nbsp;IT. This has never existed in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;enterprise computing. From the days of&nbsp;IT staff in&nbsp;white lab coats managing huge mainframe computers to&nbsp;the present highly distributed and virtualized application environments&nbsp;&mdash; IT&nbsp;has never been able to&nbsp;keep pace with the demands of&nbsp;the business.

# The Component Architecture Model

Technology provides the ‘fabric' - infrastructure, applications and services&nbsp;&mdash; that underpin _CEM_. Information is&nbsp;the lifeblood of&nbsp;any value chain in&nbsp;today&rsquo;s global economy and that ‘blood supply' should connect the farthest reaches of&nbsp;company&rsquo;s global business processes.

The dynamic and configurable nature of&nbsp;the _Composable Enterprise&trade;_ operating model places significant demands on&nbsp;the underlying technology fabric. This is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;mean a&nbsp;radical departure from the legacy&nbsp;IT infrastructures and applications portfolios found inside most organizations today.

The majority of&nbsp;legacy&nbsp;IT environments were built to&nbsp;support a&nbsp;much more static business model. It&nbsp;was assumed that business processes would remain unchanged for long periods or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;only minor modifications. Applications were generally designed to&nbsp;support the needs of&nbsp;functional silos within the business: Manufacturing, Finance, Sales, Supply-chain, Marketing, and Human-Resources etc. The growing need to&nbsp;build horizontally integrated processes between these functions has significantly challenged&nbsp;IT organizations and budgets over the last decade.

The _Composable Enterprise&trade;_ business model takes horizontal process integration to&nbsp;an&nbsp;entirely new level by&nbsp;assuming that operating functions; processes, products and services will be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;continuous change and re-configuration.

Enabling the _Composable Operating Model_ will require a&nbsp;radically new approach to&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;IT. In&nbsp;effect the _COM_ will require a&nbsp;matching _Composable&nbsp;IT Architecture_. The key attributes and capabilities for such _Composable Architecture Model_ (CAM) would be:

_Elastic Infrastructure_&nbsp;&mdash; The ability to&nbsp;scale up&nbsp;and down&nbsp;IT infrastructure resources based on&nbsp;changing demand patterns.

_Component Service based Applications__&nbsp;&mdash;_ Implementation of&nbsp;business applications as a ‘Composition' of&nbsp;finer grained ‘atomic' services to&nbsp;enable rapid re-configuration and enhancement. This capability when combined with _Elastic Infrastructure_ enables business applications and services to&nbsp;be&nbsp;scaled rapidly to&nbsp;meet the changing consumer or&nbsp;business demands.

_Auto Everything_&nbsp;&mdash; The technology fabric should be&nbsp;architected to&nbsp;require the minimum of&nbsp;human intervention. Dynamic re-configuration of&nbsp;services, elastic resource provisioning and operations should be&nbsp;fully automated.

_Unified Master Data Model_ &mdash;&nbsp;Implementation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;business defined and governed master data model providing a&nbsp;single-source-of data truth across the business.

_Integrated Analytics_&nbsp;&mdash; All data to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;the business for decision-making, consumer and market insights, process and operational analytics should be&nbsp;aggregated in&nbsp;one integrated repository. This ensures a&nbsp;single-source-of-truth for all data based business decisions.

_People Services__&nbsp;&mdash;_ The fabric should expose core services that enable role-based user authentication and user profile management to&nbsp;facilitate expertise discovery and rapid organizational re-configuration.

_Process Services__&nbsp;&mdash;_ The fabric should expose core services that facilitate process monitoring and workflow integration to&nbsp;facilitate rapid process re-configuration.

_Data Services__&nbsp;&mdash;_ All master and analytics data should be&nbsp;accessible through standards based _data access services_ and should be&nbsp;consumable in&nbsp;both human and machine accessible form.__

_Any Time, Anywhere, Any Device Access__&nbsp;&mdash;_ Operational applications should be&nbsp;made available using a&nbsp;web based ‘Software as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service' (SaaS) delivery model accessible from any device capable of&nbsp;running a&nbsp;modern web browser.

The purpose of&nbsp;these requirements is&nbsp;to&nbsp;ensure that&nbsp;IT applications and services can be&nbsp;managed and delivered with the same level of&nbsp;granularity as&nbsp;the business functions that use them.

# The Enterprise as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service

The _CEM_ approach is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the need to&nbsp;ensure seamless alignment between business operations and&nbsp;IT services because no&nbsp;matter how mundane&nbsp;&mdash; all business is _digital_ today.

Historic disconnects between&nbsp;IT and the business&nbsp;&mdash; from a&nbsp;function and rate of&nbsp;change perspective&nbsp;&mdash; are addressed under the _CEM_ approach by&nbsp;creating structural alignment between business operations and the technology architecture.

The design principles behind _COM_ and _CAM_ are identical: Decompose everything to&nbsp;the most ‘atomic' level, enable independent execution, interoperate through clearly defined interfaces and share information openly. It&nbsp;does not matter whether you are designing a&nbsp;business function or&nbsp;software component the same principles apply.

The purpose behind these high level principles is&nbsp;straight forward&nbsp;&mdash; even if&nbsp;implementation may not be: To&nbsp;facilitate, rapid adaptability, response to&nbsp;changing demand patterns and flexible and robust operations.

Implementation of _CEM_ requires the implementation of&nbsp;both _COM_ and _CAM_. Combining _COM_ and _CAM_ enables us&nbsp;to&nbsp;view the _Enterprise as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service_: A&nbsp;matched portfolio of&nbsp;functional, organizational and technology components that enable rapid re-configuration in&nbsp;response to&nbsp;future demands of&nbsp;a&nbsp;modern digital services economy.
