The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13737141" target="_blank">growing slaughter</a> of&nbsp;innocent civilians by&nbsp;the Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad&nbsp;&mdash; and his brother Maher Assad&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;posing quite a&nbsp;challenge for the international community which risks a&nbsp;re-run of&nbsp;the impotence demonstrated during the Balkan crisis. The situation in&nbsp;Syria is&nbsp;different however and opens doors to&nbsp;more creative approaches at&nbsp;intervention. Its time to&nbsp;deploy the high-tech tools of&nbsp;information warfare.

<!--more-->

The regime currently operates with impunity because they have almost total control over the information flow out of&nbsp;the country. The ban on&nbsp;foreign journalists entering the country means that apologists for the regime like Reem Haddad&nbsp;&mdash; whose perfect english tones and presentation skills maker her one of&nbsp;the scariest individuals I&nbsp;have encountered&nbsp;&mdash; control the news agenda. A&nbsp;particularly obnoxious example of&nbsp;her spin can be&nbsp;found [here](http://www.npr.org/2011/06/09/137089311/syrian-spokeswoman-discusses-reports-of-government-torture). It&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t matter how ludicrous are her statements, anyone interviewing her is&nbsp;left defenseless without hard facts from on&nbsp;the ground.

This complete control over the flow of&nbsp;information of&nbsp;course emboldens the regime and means they feel they can act with impunity and very little fear of&nbsp;consequence. Imagine for a&nbsp;moment if&nbsp;high quality&nbsp;&mdash; independently verified video&nbsp;&mdash; of&nbsp;the military shooting innocent&nbsp;&mdash; peaceful demonstrators was being shown on&nbsp;the BBC and CBS every evening. Ms&nbsp;Haddad would have a&nbsp;very hard time spinning her way out of&nbsp;that situation and Russian and Chinese objections to&nbsp;the implementations of&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;UN resolutions would be&nbsp;very hard to&nbsp;avoid.

The solution to&nbsp;this information drought already exists and it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t even need &laquo;Boots on&nbsp;the ground.&raquo; Its called a <a href="httphttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-1_Predator://" target="_blank">Predator</a> and its a&nbsp;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with very sophisticated video surveillance capabilities. The&nbsp;US deploys predator drones over Afghanistan and Iraq every day for exactly this type of <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2009/11/02/Drone-surveillance-capabilities-touted/UPI-94741257182620/" target="_blank">intelligence gathering</a>. Syria&rsquo;s geographic location&nbsp;&mdash; being surrounded by&nbsp;US allies&nbsp;&mdash; Turkey, Jordan and Israel&nbsp;&mdash; would provide perfect bases for launching such surveillance flights and would provide the short flight times necessary to&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;rapidly developing situations. Deploying predators over Syria would bring much needed balance to&nbsp;the flow of&nbsp;information.

As&nbsp;with all plans there will be&nbsp;objections to&nbsp;this one. Syria will squeal to&nbsp;the&nbsp;UN about breaches of&nbsp;it&nbsp;territorial rights. However, slaughtering your own citizens and gross human rights violations probably doesn&rsquo;t give you the highest ground in&nbsp;that debate. Syria also has a&nbsp;very effective army and air-force capability&nbsp;&mdash; unlike Libya. It&nbsp;also has surface to&nbsp;air defenses so&nbsp;a&nbsp;few drones are probably going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;enemy fire in&nbsp;the campaign. However, the knowledge that&nbsp;&mdash; at&nbsp;any minute&nbsp;&mdash; your actions on&nbsp;the ground may be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;high-resolution video surveillance may be&nbsp;threat enough to&nbsp;have the regime think again about its strategy.

In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view the benefits of&nbsp;deploying this capability far outweigh any possible objections. These high-tech &laquo;Eyes in&nbsp;the Sky&raquo; have all the capability needed to&nbsp;feed real-time high quality video direct from scene and that is&nbsp;exactly what the population of&nbsp;Syria needs right now. Barbarous dictators like the Assad brothers like to&nbsp;operate under the cloak of&nbsp;darkness.

It&nbsp;really is&nbsp;time to&nbsp;turn on&nbsp;the spot-light.
