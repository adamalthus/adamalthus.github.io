If&nbsp;it&nbsp;looks like your being offered something for nothing then take a&nbsp;second look. You&rsquo;ll almost always end up&nbsp;paying somewhere down the line. However, when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;cloud computing a ‘Free Lunch' may become a&nbsp;very real possibility.

Amazon, Microsoft and Google are engaged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;battle for market share and customer loyalty which has seen the price of&nbsp;basic computing resources decline preciptously over recent years. Therein lies the free lunch. However, each of&nbsp;them expects to&nbsp;monetize this growing customers base buy charging for higher level services. There&rsquo;s the rub. Maximizing the free lunch oportunity will require smart customers to&nbsp;figure out how to&nbsp;dine inexpensively while limiting consumption of&nbsp;that expensive bottle of&nbsp;wine.

The price of&nbsp;the basic components of&nbsp;computing&nbsp;&mdash; CPU, disk storage and memory&nbsp;&mdash; as&nbsp;delieverd by&nbsp;the major cloud providers such as&nbsp;Amazon, Microsoft and Google&nbsp;&mdash; has had a&nbsp;tremendous downard trajectory. Amazon trumpets the fact that its most recent instance price decreases were its <a title="" href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-price-reduction-42-ec2-s3-rds-elasticache-and-elastic-mapreduce/" target="_blank">42nd such reduction since 2008</a>. Microsoft and Google have continued to&nbsp;match Amazon&rsquo;s pricing declines.

The ongoing decline in&nbsp;the price of&nbsp;the raw materials of&nbsp;cloud computing shows no&nbsp;signs of&nbsp;slowing down which leaves one to&nbsp;draw the conclusion that&nbsp;&mdash; within some reasonable time horizon&nbsp;&mdash; the price will approximate zero&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;as&nbsp;close as&nbsp;makes no&nbsp;difference. Clearly not even the global scale economics of&nbsp;Amazon, Microsoft or&nbsp;Google enable you to&nbsp;give away computing for free, so&nbsp;what&rsquo;s going on?

My <a title="" href="http://www.adamalthus.com/blog/2013/04/01/the-laws-of-platform-economics/" target="_blank">First Law of&nbsp;Platform Economics</a> states that &laquo;Value alway moves up&nbsp;the stack&raquo; IE. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;always the case that the lower layers of&nbsp;any generation of&nbsp;platform archiecture eventually become comoditized and therefore value tends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;extracted by&nbsp;monetizing services higher and higher in&nbsp;the stack over time. Once upon a&nbsp;time you could make money selling operating systems, then databases and then line-of-business applications. This was the trajectory of&nbsp;the last ‘client-server' wave of&nbsp;technology. Cloud is&nbsp;no&nbsp;different.

It&rsquo;s very likely that the three behemoths of&nbsp;the global cloud ecosystem are using thier scale to&nbsp;drive pricing of&nbsp;the raw materials to&nbsp;zero. This is&nbsp;to&nbsp;their significant advantage as&nbsp;it&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;huge pricing barrier to&nbsp;entry for smaller less-scaled players. Being able to&nbsp;amortize very sizeable capital investments and operational costs over a&nbsp;rapidly growing customer base helps them. Forgoeing margins&nbsp;&mdash; profitability&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;secure maket share and a&nbsp;growing subscriber base is&nbsp;exactly the right strategy now but ultimately it&nbsp;will need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;supplanted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;strategy which extracts value from those captured customers.

This&nbsp;&mdash; admitedly somewhat dated&nbsp;&mdash; <a title="" href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/amazon-web-services-by-the-numbers/" target="_blank">set of&nbsp;charts from GigaOm</a> paints a&nbsp;very clear picture of&nbsp;how Amazon see thier strategy unfolding. In&nbsp;short Amazon are giving away the raw materials beacuse they&rsquo;re betting that eventually customers will pay for higher level services&nbsp;&mdash; value always moves up&nbsp;the stack.

The set of&nbsp;services Amazon are building out include data and media processing pipelines, analytics services and the like. At&nbsp;some point it&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;surprinsing to&nbsp;see them offer what we&nbsp;would think of&nbsp;today as&nbsp;full line-of-business solutions. The strategy from Google, Microsoft and others is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;no different. So&nbsp;what is&nbsp;it&nbsp;going to&nbsp;take to&nbsp;maximize this opportunity?

Customers wanting to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;ongoing declines in&nbsp;computing resource pricing&nbsp;&mdash; while avoiding the expense of&nbsp;higher level services&nbsp;&mdash; require a&nbsp;strategy that lets them consume raw computing resources at&nbsp;an&nbsp;ever declining cost while insulating themselves from the need to&nbsp;buy into costly higher level services.

The default choice for most organizations will be&nbsp;to&nbsp;build new cloud based applications ‘Natively' on&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific cloud providers fabric. On&nbsp;the surface this strategy is&nbsp;appealing but has the significant disavantage of&nbsp;binding workloads directly to&nbsp;API&rsquo;s native to&nbsp;that fabric. In&nbsp;effect customers would end up&nbsp;merely substituting one set of&nbsp;&mdash; legacy&nbsp;&mdash; vendor dependecies with another. Once built natively the lifecycle costs of&nbsp;managing these new workloads will be&nbsp;bound to&nbsp;the cloud vendors unique monetization strategy.

A ‘Free lunch' strategy requires the ability to&nbsp;decouple new cloud based application workloads from dependence on&nbsp;any one infrastructure vendor. This approach requires customers to&nbsp;take control of&nbsp;the platform layer between applictaions and the underlying infrastructure. The decoupling afforded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;new generation of&nbsp;Platform as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service (PaaS) offerings such as&nbsp;Cloud Foundry is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good starting point.

Building on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;service platform which is&nbsp;decoupled from the underlying infrastructure will enable customers to&nbsp;keep control of&nbsp;thier own destiny. Every organization will need to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;appropriate economic analysis of&nbsp;this new buy vs. build dynamic. But there&rsquo;s no&nbsp;escaping the imperative for cloud infrastructure vendors to&nbsp;evenutally monetize higher level services to&nbsp;pay for the raw materials they are giving away for free.

Customer&rsquo;s whose strategies maximize choice and reduce thier dependence on&nbsp;any one specific cloud provider&rsquo;s offerings will be&nbsp;best positioned to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;what is&nbsp;likley to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;free lunch opportunity.
