Microsoft posted a&nbsp;record quarterly profit of $4.5B on&nbsp;record revenue of $16.04B after the markets closed yesterday. The EPS of&nbsp;51 cents blew away analysts consensus forecasts of&nbsp;46 cents for the quarter. Any other company announcing a&nbsp;financial performance of&nbsp;this magnitude would have seen its shares pop in&nbsp;after hours trading; not Microsoft. Of&nbsp;course that may change when the market open today but it&nbsp;is a&nbsp;telling marker of&nbsp;investor sentiment towards the company.

In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view its one more indication that the company&rsquo;s true value is&nbsp;being overshadowed by a 'Crisis of&nbsp;Perception.' Investors see Microsoft as&nbsp;a&nbsp;vision-less consumer company struggling to&nbsp;compete with Apple and Google while in&nbsp;actuality its an&nbsp;innovation machine transforming the world of&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;IT. You only have to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;numbers like the <a title="Microsoft Quarterly Earnings" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msft/earnings/fy10/earn_rel_q4_10.mspx" target="_blank">unearned revenue line</a> (A&nbsp;proxy for new long term annuity contract signings with enterprise customers) to&nbsp;see just how much an&nbsp;enterprise machine the company&nbsp;is. That number grew 20% in&nbsp;FY'10!

Of&nbsp;course the lack of&nbsp;pop in&nbsp;the stock is&nbsp;likely relate to&nbsp;the fact that the company continued to&nbsp;pour cash into its search and mobile phone efforts as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the other loss-making consumer focused on-line properties.

In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view it&nbsp;is&nbsp;time to&nbsp;stop the pretense that Microsoft can become a 'Cool' high growth and highly profitable consumer products company. The enterprise DNA of&nbsp;the company just isn&rsquo;t going to&nbsp;mutate quickly enough to&nbsp;let that happen in&nbsp;any reasonable period of&nbsp;time. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion the situation requires radical surgery. This would include spinning off XBox into a&nbsp;separate games focused company, merging the consumer on-line assets with Yahoo to&nbsp;give them scale in&nbsp;a&nbsp;competitive race with Google and finally ditching the phone business.

Yes I&nbsp;did say get out of&nbsp;the phone business. Here&rsquo;s my&nbsp;prediction: Windows Phone 7 will be&nbsp;the 'Zune' to&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s iPhone and Google&rsquo;s Android i.e. cool competitive technology with no&nbsp;chance of&nbsp;building the scale required to&nbsp;compete with those other platforms. It&rsquo;s time to&nbsp;stop wasting money on&nbsp;phone which could be&nbsp;better leveraged elsewhere in&nbsp;the product portfolio.

A&nbsp;slimmed down Microsoft that was entirely focused on&nbsp;delivering the worlds best enterprise business platforms might not be 'Cool' but it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot more interesting for both customers and shareholders. The development teams would regain the focus and investment dollars they need to&nbsp;extend their competitive advantages in&nbsp;this market and the move to&nbsp;achieving and maintaining leadership in&nbsp;cloud services would be&nbsp;accelerated. The change would also address the 'Perception' issues which are overshadowing investors opinions about the stock. Without the consumer business 'Boat anchor' the company could increase R&D spending in&nbsp;its core business AND return substantially more to&nbsp;share-holders in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;dividend payments. Turning Microsoft into a&nbsp;dividend paying machine is&nbsp;one sure way to&nbsp;move the stock.

If&nbsp;the board and executive team really do&nbsp;recognize their responsibility to&nbsp;maximize value for shareholders then its time for them to&nbsp;focus the company on&nbsp;what it&nbsp;does really well; building the world&rsquo;s best enterprise software and cloud services. Unfortunately stories about new attempts to <a title="Be What's Next" href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/215449.asp" target="_blank">re-brand</a> the company just reinforce the view that senior leadership is&nbsp;missing the point and is&nbsp;intent on&nbsp;continuing the long march to&nbsp;irrelevance. If&nbsp;that&rsquo;s the case then maybe it&nbsp;really is <a title="Coup Brewing at Microsoft?" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-coup-brews-at-microsoft-2010-7" target="_blank">time for new management.</a>
