The UK&rsquo;s Royal Society has just <a title="BBC News" href="http://bit.ly/clQa61" target="_blank">announced</a> a&nbsp;major new research project on&nbsp;the implications of&nbsp;population growth. The study is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be headed by&nbsp;the Nobel Laureate, Sir John Sulston. As&nbsp;the&nbsp;RI points out populations studies is&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;cyclical area of&nbsp;research. The '60s and '70s were a&nbsp;boom time for the field with less focus being given the the subject in&nbsp;the '80s and '90s. The fact that the topic is&nbsp;moving back up&nbsp;the political agenda probably has much to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the intersection of&nbsp;population on&nbsp;two key policy issues; economic growth and climate change.

The political debate about population growth has being going on&nbsp;for nearly three hundred years. Thomas Malthus, seen as&nbsp;the father of&nbsp;demography, clearly held the view that exponential population growth would outstrip improvements in&nbsp;agricultural production, condemning economies to&nbsp;a&nbsp;permanent state of&nbsp;subsistence. Adam Smith on&nbsp;the other hand believed that economic growth and improvements in&nbsp;people&rsquo;s socioeconomic circumstances would reduce fertility rates over time.

    World Population Growth Rate Over Time

There&rsquo;s a&nbsp;prima facie case supporting Smith&rsquo;s assertions. The fertility rate of&nbsp;many of&nbsp;the world&rsquo;s most developed economies (Much of&nbsp;Europe, UK, Japan etc. but notably not the United States due in&nbsp;large part to&nbsp;the impacts of&nbsp;immigration) has tumbled over the last forty years. That decline has mirrored a&nbsp;period of&nbsp;massive economic growth and rising living standards in&nbsp;these countries. The 'Baby boom' has become the 'Baby bust' with very significant implications for affected geographies. As&nbsp;the demographic mix inverts there are fewer and fewer younger workers able to&nbsp;carry the social cost of&nbsp;the rising number of&nbsp;elderly in&nbsp;the population.

Interestingly, even though the total global population is&nbsp;still growing the _rate of&nbsp;growth_ has in&nbsp;decline since the mid-sixties. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;diversity of&nbsp;research which shows that fertility rate has an&nbsp;inverse relationship with factors like educational level (Particularly in&nbsp;Women) and income level. If&nbsp;the&nbsp;RI study is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be useful in&nbsp;guiding policy makers then it&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;deliver some definitive research on&nbsp;which factors really do&nbsp;impact fertility rates, and in&nbsp;what manner.

There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;perspective (One I&nbsp;do&nbsp;not subscribe to) that a&nbsp;growing global population is&nbsp;required to&nbsp;sustain the needed levels of&nbsp;economic growth. The argument is&nbsp;put forward that continued growth in&nbsp;the production of&nbsp;manufactured goods will require and expanding workforce to&nbsp;make those goods. This gets to&nbsp;the heart of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;personal interests regarding the impact of&nbsp;technology on&nbsp;economic growth. I&nbsp;would argue that the opposite scenario is&nbsp;more likely i.e. that even an&nbsp;increasing supply of&nbsp;manufactured goods will requires less, not more workers over time.

The number of&nbsp;workers now employed in&nbsp;building cars in&nbsp;the most advanced and automated factories today is&nbsp;diminishingly small compared to&nbsp;just thirty years ago. With continued advances in&nbsp;robotics, process control technology and information systems this trend is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;continue. Fifty years from now its likely that many factories will ingest raw materials at&nbsp;one end and spit out finished good at&nbsp;the other with very few human workers required in-between.

To&nbsp;date this trend has been countered by&nbsp;the relative ease with which manufacturing facilities can be&nbsp;trans-located into low wage economies. However, the very act of&nbsp;introducing manufacturing into low wage economies has the effect of&nbsp;raising living standards and worker expectations which in&nbsp;turn leads to&nbsp;demands to&nbsp;higher wages. When combined with worker shortages this can place a&nbsp;significant upward pressure on&nbsp;wages undermining the location&rsquo;s original cost advantage. China is&nbsp;now <a title="China wages rise" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/business/global/27yuan.html" target="_blank">witnessing this phenomenon</a> with many manufacturers now looking to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;other lower wage cost East Asian economies. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view this will over time lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;leveling of&nbsp;the global wage cost 'Playing field'. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;reach that point the pressure to&nbsp;innovate in&nbsp;manufacturing automation will become extreme because that will be&nbsp;the only way to&nbsp;avoid being caught between the <a title="Smith and Malthus" href="http://www.adamalthus.com/why-adamalthus/" target="_self">'Pin factory' and the 'Invisible hand'</a>. As&nbsp;global manufacturing competition shifts from trying to&nbsp;find the lowest wage economy to&nbsp;finding the cheapest way to&nbsp;manufacture through automation we&nbsp;will see a&nbsp;dramatic reduction in&nbsp;the global manufacturing work force.

The challenges with this scenario are daunting. If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;truly a&nbsp;correlation between rising income levels and declining fertility rates then a&nbsp;long period of&nbsp;technology lead efficiency improvements in&nbsp;manufacturing and its concomitant positive impact on&nbsp;economic output should correlate with a&nbsp;continued slowing of&nbsp;the global population growth rate. If&nbsp;the point is&nbsp;reached where global population growth rate becomes negative then you enter into the potentially 'Utopian' situation where a&nbsp;smaller and smaller global population shares an&nbsp;ever growing economic pie. Alternatively, if&nbsp;the global manufacturing work force continues to&nbsp;shrink due to&nbsp;automation while the population continues to&nbsp;grow and those lost manufacturing jobs can not be&nbsp;more than offset by&nbsp;growth in&nbsp;services sector employment then you have a&nbsp;political time-bomb on&nbsp;your hands.

I&nbsp;seriously hope the&nbsp;RI study will look at&nbsp;the the correlation of&nbsp;population dynamics and economic growth and will factor in&nbsp;the role that technology will play on&nbsp;both sides of&nbsp;the equation. The likely impact of&nbsp;climate change on&nbsp;these issues I&nbsp;will leave for another post.
