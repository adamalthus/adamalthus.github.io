As&nbsp;a&nbsp;domain&nbsp;IT requires deeply specialized skills, the language of&nbsp;IT is&nbsp;arcane and business needs require multiple levels of&nbsp;translation and interpretation before being implemented as&nbsp;systems. This conceptual complexity creates a&nbsp;significant barrier between business and&nbsp;IT leadership. But there&rsquo;s a&nbsp;bigger problem: The most _complex_ issue facing&nbsp;IT today is&nbsp;technology itself.

The&nbsp;IT infrastructure of&nbsp;most reasonably sized businesses is&nbsp;a&nbsp;horrendous _cats cradle_ of&nbsp;interconnection and information flow between multiple aging systems that were never designed to&nbsp;work together and yet the emergence of&nbsp;horizontally integrated&nbsp;&mdash; and increasingly globally distributed&nbsp;&mdash; business processes demands and depends on&nbsp;the friction free flow of&nbsp;information.

_Time-to-Value_ is&nbsp;perhaps the most important metric in&nbsp;today&rsquo;s dynamic, competitive service-led economy but against this measure most corporate&nbsp;IT organizations fail miserably. The requirement for&nbsp;IT to&nbsp;keep pace with the speed of&nbsp;business has never been greater but the ugly reality for most CIOs is&nbsp;that the _complexity_ of&nbsp;their&nbsp;IT infrastructures is&nbsp;overwhelming and an&nbsp;increasing percentage of&nbsp;IT budgets is&nbsp;now spent on&nbsp;maintaining and integrating aging legacy systems rather than delivering new value to&nbsp;the business.

No&nbsp;wonder most CEOs are skeptical about the strategic value of&nbsp;IT.<!--more-->

## Scarcity and Complexity

Our legacy&nbsp;IT systems are inflexible, difficult to&nbsp;integrate with each other and require incredible effort and resources to&nbsp;transform to&nbsp;meet the needs of&nbsp;modern business strategies and service models. Even when we&nbsp;do&nbsp;successfully integrate multiple systems the cost of&nbsp;operating and maintaining these complex&nbsp;&mdash; and fragile&nbsp;&mdash; environments is&nbsp;unacceptably high.

The vast majority of&nbsp;business&nbsp;IT systems operating today are the product of&nbsp;what Zysman and I&nbsp;call the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Scarcity&raquo;&nbsp;&mdash; the period until 2006 where computation, storage, program memory and bandwidth were treated as&nbsp;scarce and often incredibly expensive resources.

As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the resource economics of&nbsp;the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Scarcity&raquo; the architecture of&nbsp;IT systems focused on&nbsp;shepherding and optimizing the resources used every layer of&nbsp;software in&nbsp;the architecture.

An&nbsp;IT system designed during the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Scarcity&raquo; can be&nbsp;likened to&nbsp;a&nbsp;finely crafted watch. Each part is&nbsp;precisely engineered and is&nbsp;highly optimized for its function and each part has a&nbsp;distinct role to&nbsp;play. The parts making up&nbsp;a&nbsp;pocket watch cannot easily be&nbsp;transformed into a&nbsp;wrist watch: So&nbsp;it&nbsp;is with most&nbsp;IT systems today.

Wrist watches and today&rsquo;s&nbsp;IT infrastructures are examples of _tightly coupled_ systems. Each component of&nbsp;the system is&nbsp;designed and optimized to&nbsp;work only within a&nbsp;unique context. The drive to&nbsp;high degrees of&nbsp;optimization means that parts cannot be&nbsp;shared or&nbsp;re-used in&nbsp;other contexts. It&nbsp;also means that the failure of&nbsp;one part&nbsp;&mdash; more often than not&nbsp;&mdash; causes a&nbsp;failure of&nbsp;the entire system: _Tightly coupled_ systems are often highly fragile.

The more _tightly coupled_ a&nbsp;system is&nbsp;the more difficult it&nbsp;becomes to&nbsp;add new capabilities and to&nbsp;integrate one system with another. Tightly coupled systems are optimized within themselves but create significant friction when we&nbsp;try to&nbsp;use them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;broader context not anticipated by&nbsp;the original designers.

The overwhelming complexity of&nbsp;most business&nbsp;IT infrastructures arose directly from the historic need to&nbsp;build _tightly coupled_ systems in&nbsp;order optimize the use of&nbsp;scare computing resources. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;now attempt to&nbsp;satisfy the needs of&nbsp;complex global business models the many limitations of&nbsp;this _tightly coupled_ approach are becoming abundantly clear.

That most&nbsp;IT departments are today failing to&nbsp;deliver new capability at&nbsp;the rate demanded by&nbsp;the business is&nbsp;no&nbsp;surprise. The complexity and fragility of&nbsp;systems designed during the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Scarcity&raquo; makes them not fit for purpose for the era we&nbsp;are now entering.

## Abundance and Opportunity

In&nbsp;2006 Amazon launched their new &laquo;Amazon Web Services&raquo; business. Amazon placed a&nbsp;bet on&nbsp;the coming &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Abundance&raquo; when computing resources would be&nbsp;both cheap and _essentially_ unlimited.

The economics of&nbsp;computing crossed a&nbsp;threshold in&nbsp;2006. Computation, storage and&nbsp;&mdash; increasingly&nbsp;&mdash; network bandwidth had become commodities. As&nbsp;the supply of&nbsp;available computational power outstripped demand, prices declined and Amazon saw an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;become the _de&nbsp;facto_ utility provider of&nbsp;this new era.

As&nbsp;was the case during the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Scarcity&raquo; the new commodity economics of&nbsp;the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Abundance&raquo; is&nbsp;driving a&nbsp;fundamental shift in&nbsp;IT systems architecture. This new approach to&nbsp;architecture is&nbsp;commonly referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;&laquo;Cloud Computing.&raquo; <a href="http://wp.me/p2ugSA-c0" target="_blank">[A short guide to&nbsp;cloud computing can be&nbsp;found here]</a>

If&nbsp;a&nbsp;tightly coupled approach to&nbsp;application and systems architecture was the optimal solution during the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Scarcity&raquo; then the opposite&nbsp;&mdash; _loosely coupled_&nbsp;&mdash; approach is&nbsp;the defining characteristic of _abundant_ cloud computing architectures.

Abundant and cheap computing resources mean that systems today can be&nbsp;designed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;flexible from the start.

Modern cloud based applications are designed to&nbsp;scale elastically as&nbsp;user demand waxes and wanes. New cloud based approaches to&nbsp;data storage keep multiple copies of&nbsp;data in&nbsp;different locations to&nbsp;improve performance and reliability. Multiple layers of&nbsp;management software are used to&nbsp;decouple applications from the underlying infrastructure to&nbsp;improve scalability and reliability.

Well designed cloud computing systems take a&nbsp;&laquo;Lego building block&raquo; approach to&nbsp;their architecture. The APIs&nbsp;&mdash; Application Programming Interfaces&nbsp;&mdash; between components are a _contract_ defined using standard and open protocols. These _contracts_ are the glue that define the structure of _loosely coupled_ cloud architectures.

The use of&nbsp;APIs between system components is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;building _loosely coupled_ systems. This approach enables different systems&nbsp;&mdash; designed independently&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rapidly integrated and re-configured as&nbsp;needed by&nbsp;the business. Individual building blocks can be&nbsp;replaced over time as&nbsp;new technologies and better approaches become available. Systems based on&nbsp;cloud architectures are designed from the start to&nbsp;be&nbsp;both composable and reconfigurable.

## The Great Decoupling

The arrival of&nbsp;the &laquo;Era of&nbsp;Abundance&raquo; and with it&nbsp;the emergence of&nbsp;new cloud computing architectures may very well offer a&nbsp;light at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;IT&rsquo;s complexity tunnel.

The ability to&nbsp;now design and construct a&nbsp;new generation of _loosely coupled_ business systems based on&nbsp;cloud computing architectures offers the opportunity for&nbsp;IT departments to&nbsp;deliver flexible, scalable, reliable and agile solutions at&nbsp;a&nbsp;pace demanded by&nbsp;business leaders. The concept of _loose coupling_ may turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;solvent that finally dissolves IT&rsquo;s historic complexity problem.

It&rsquo;s interesting to&nbsp;note that both mobile computing and BigData are also decoupling mechanisms. Mobile computing _decouples_ information access and physical location. New approaches to&nbsp;Big-Data and analytics _decouple_ the need to&nbsp;understand how data is&nbsp;structured from questions that will be&nbsp;asked over that data in&nbsp;the future. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the _decoupling_ effect of&nbsp;these technologies that makes them such powerful transformation tools.

Accomplishing the transformation from a&nbsp;complex, fragile and _tightly coupled_ legacy environment to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new generation of&nbsp;agile, scalable, fault-tolerant _loosely coupled_ systems will be&nbsp;the defining challenge for every CIO. As&nbsp;difficult as&nbsp;the transformation might be&nbsp;it&nbsp;is now not one that can be&nbsp;avoided. The career of&nbsp;most CIOs will hinge on&nbsp;the outcome.

The combination of&nbsp;cloud computing architectures, mobile computing and Big-Data analytics represent the &laquo;Great Decoupling&raquo; of&nbsp;business&nbsp;IT. The flexibility and agility of&nbsp;the systems that result from this will enable a&nbsp;fundamental transformation in&nbsp;the way we&nbsp;do&nbsp;business. The powerful combination of _loosely coupled_ business processes and&nbsp;IT systems will turn complexity from something we&nbsp;struggle to&nbsp;control and overcome into something we&nbsp;embrace and exploit.
