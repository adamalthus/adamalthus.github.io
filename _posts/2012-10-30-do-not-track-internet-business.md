Imagine a&nbsp;world where all internet browsers are required to&nbsp;present users with a&nbsp;simple question: &laquo;Do&nbsp;you want your online browsing activity tracked, recorded and shared with marketing companies&nbsp;&mdash; Yes or&nbsp;No?&raquo;

What percentage of&nbsp;users do&nbsp;you suppose would answer &laquo;No?&raquo; My&nbsp;guess would be&nbsp;greater than 90%. If I&rsquo;m anywhere close to&nbsp;being correct then Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2012/october/default-browser-do-not-track-setting-will-result-in-less-online-content-say-advertisers/" target="_blank">controversial decision</a> to&nbsp;enable '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_track" target="_blank">Do&nbsp;Not Track</a>' (DNT) by&nbsp;default in&nbsp;IE10 and Windows 8 would seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very much inline with consumer sentiment. But <a href="http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/analetter-microsoft" target="_blank">advertisers</a>, <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20121026/yahoo-dings-do-not-track-default-and-search-partner-microsoft/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>, and the developers of&nbsp;both the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/apache-webserver-updated-to-ignore-do-not-track-settings-in-ie-10/" target="_blank">Apache web server</a> and <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2012/05/31/do-not-track-its-the-users-voice-that-matters/" target="_blank">FireFox</a> browsers are all decrying Microsoft&rsquo;s decision.

This relatively arcane debate over a&nbsp;new internet standard masks a&nbsp;much more critical issue: In&nbsp;the long-term, how viable is&nbsp;the internet&rsquo;s&nbsp;&mdash; advertising based&nbsp;&mdash; 'Free' content model?

Advertising revenue is&nbsp;the internet&rsquo;s predominant business model. This is&nbsp;of&nbsp;course the core business model that enabled Google to&nbsp;become the 800 lb. gorilla of&nbsp;the industry. But this business model is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;users accepting a 'Faustian' pact where they agree to&nbsp;increasingly invasive tracking of&nbsp;their online activities in&nbsp;exchange for free content.

There&rsquo;s only one small problem with the current situation. Very few consumers have ever read or&nbsp;consented to&nbsp;the 'Contract.' Most of&nbsp;consumers have no&nbsp;earthly idea how invasive today&rsquo;s internet tracking technology is&nbsp;and once they are aware they are not going to&nbsp;like it.

<!--more-->

The howls of&nbsp;outrage from advertisers and from sites like Yahoo&nbsp;&mdash; that depend on&nbsp;advertising revenue for their very existence&nbsp;&mdash; about Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to&nbsp;enable DNT by&nbsp;default mask a&nbsp;much deeper fear. Once online consumers realize the true value of&nbsp;their '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickstream" target="_blank">click-stream</a>' perhaps they will start asking for a&nbsp;lot more in&nbsp;return. Maybe the fallacy of 'free' content on&nbsp;the internet will be&nbsp;made transparent with all the dire consequences that would entail for the companies that depend on&nbsp;this business model.

Here&rsquo;s a&nbsp;suggestion. If&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;&mdash; <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2012/05/31/do-not-track-its-the-users-voice-that-matters/" target="_blank">and others</a>&nbsp;&mdash; are so&nbsp;concerned that DNT should require an&nbsp;explicit opt-in by&nbsp;consumers then lets implement the solution I&nbsp;alluded to&nbsp;in&nbsp;my open question. Every browser should prompt the user to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;explicit choice for the DNT setting during installation or&nbsp;upgrade. How could that possibly be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad thing? It&nbsp;would avoid taking Microsoft&rsquo;s assumed default approach and yet it&nbsp;would ensure that every consumer was made aware of&nbsp;the option and given a&nbsp;choice.

I&nbsp;suspect that advertisers would absolutely hate the idea of&nbsp;requiring an&nbsp;explicit and visible opt-in for the simple reason that they already know that the most users would opt <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tracked.

All of&nbsp;this raises profound questions about the long-term viability of&nbsp;the internet&rsquo;s only proven business model. I&nbsp;suspect that the implementation and awareness of&nbsp;DNT is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;force many consumers to&nbsp;confront their 'Deal with the devil' and many are not going to&nbsp;like the bargain they have struck.

As&nbsp;consumer resentment over invasive click-stream tracking grows the viability of&nbsp;purely advertising based content business models will come into serious question.

Companies that depend solely&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;largely&nbsp;&mdash; on&nbsp;online advertising driven revenue streams&nbsp;&mdash; Google, Yahoo etc. &mdash;&nbsp;have a&nbsp;major strategic problem. How will they survive if&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;&mdash; as&nbsp;I&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;&mdash; decide they do&nbsp;not want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tracked? The undermining of&nbsp;the current model of&nbsp;free content in&nbsp;exchange for your behavioral data will require a&nbsp;re-think of&nbsp;internet business models.

Consumer awareness about the value of&nbsp;their behavioral data&nbsp;&mdash; highlighted by&nbsp;options such as&nbsp;DNT&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;make paid content models much more attractive. Smart paid content providers will find ways to&nbsp;amplify consumers fears about being tracked. Like the emperors new clothes 'Free Content' will be&nbsp;seen to&nbsp;be&nbsp;not free at&nbsp;all. Consumers will then need to&nbsp;decide whether a&nbsp;much more transparent contract&nbsp;&mdash; where they pay to&nbsp;access content without giving up&nbsp;their privacy&nbsp;&mdash; isn&rsquo;t an&nbsp;entirely more acceptable way to&nbsp;browse.

Ps. I&nbsp;do&nbsp;find it&nbsp;ironic that the <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2012/05/31/do-not-track-its-the-users-voice-that-matters/" target="_blank">Mozilla appear</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;siding so&nbsp;enthusiastically with the position of&nbsp;advertisers in&nbsp;the DNT debate. Might that have something to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the fact that 98% of&nbsp;their $121Million in&nbsp;2011 revenue came from advertising based search royalties?

Pps. Here&rsquo;s a&nbsp;prediction. If&nbsp;the internet/advertising industry does not voluntarily implement the proactive DNT choice notification I&nbsp;suggested above then they will find themselves forced to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so within the next five years. I&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;surprised to&nbsp;learn that European Commission bureaucrats are just waiting for the DNT specification to&nbsp;be&nbsp;completed and ratified before making this demand of&nbsp;all browser manufacturers.
