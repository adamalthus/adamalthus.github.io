The&nbsp;NY Times published an <a title="Disruptions: At Amazon, the Robot World Comes a Little Closer" href="http://nyti.ms/HqlDMT" target="_blank">interesting article</a> today the impact of&nbsp;robotics on&nbsp;manufacturing jobs using Amazon&rsquo;s purchase of&nbsp;robot maker <a title="Amazon.com to Acquire Manufacturer of Robotics" href="http://nyti.ms/HqoN38" target="">Kiva Systems</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;exemplar. The core question raised in&nbsp;the article is&nbsp;whether the adoption of&nbsp;automation technologies will create more unemployment or&nbsp;whether&nbsp;&mdash; as&nbsp;has been seen in&nbsp;the past&nbsp;&mdash; displaced workers will re-train and become employed in&nbsp;other productive areas of&nbsp;the economy. <!--more-->

The authors quote Lawrence Summers views on&nbsp;the matter:

> There has long been a&nbsp;mentality that we&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;run out of&nbsp;work to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and there is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an absence of&nbsp;work for people," Mr. Summers said. &laquo;Both have been asserted in&nbsp;every generation and always historically been wrong. In&nbsp;reality, if&nbsp;people are freed up&nbsp;from one thing they are able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something different.

I&nbsp;believe Mr&nbsp;Summers is&nbsp;quite wrong. It&nbsp;strikes me&nbsp;that his views demonstrate a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;the very profound levels of&nbsp;manufacturing automation which are becoming available. The combination of&nbsp;entirely automated production systems combined with highly integrated digital supply chains is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;make today&rsquo;s manufacturing worker an&nbsp;endangered species. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not clear at&nbsp;all how our economies would re-absorb a&nbsp;displacement of&nbsp;this magnitude. Historic patterns for employment dislocation are unlikely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good models for future realities.

The biggest impact of&nbsp;next-generation automation is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in China. The historic cost of&nbsp;labor in&nbsp;China has meant that there is&nbsp;little to&nbsp;be&nbsp;gained by&nbsp;investing in&nbsp;automated manufacturing systems. But that is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;change. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world of $150+ oil manufacturers will start to&nbsp;pay close attention to&nbsp;distribution costs. Minimizing those costs will create economic advantage. It&nbsp;will pay to&nbsp;bring manufacturing closer to&nbsp;the centers of&nbsp;consumption. That&rsquo;s good news for the United States. The repatriation of&nbsp;manufacturing from China would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;political godsend. Except that this will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;very different type of&nbsp;manufacturing.

Factories that relocate from China to&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;other developed economies&nbsp;&mdash; will not come with jobs. They will come with automation. That will be&nbsp;great for the high tech manufacturing systems sector but not for manufacturing workers. The displacement effect in&nbsp;China is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;catastrophic. Factories that today employee millions of&nbsp;workers and drive the growth of&nbsp;the consumptive middle-class will simply disappear&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;be&nbsp;replaced by&nbsp;fully automated production in&nbsp;other countries. The prospect of&nbsp;a&nbsp;generation of&nbsp;unemployed&nbsp;&mdash; restive&nbsp;&mdash; unemployed factory workers should be&nbsp;giving the Chinese political elite nightmares.

In&nbsp;the United States politician&rsquo;s promises to&nbsp;bring back manufacturing jobs will remain empty. Manufacturing may return but the jobs will not. There are two possible paths beyond this transformation. Either Summers is&nbsp;right and those displaced by&nbsp;automation will be&nbsp;re-absorbed into other sectors of&nbsp;the economy&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;he&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;m in&nbsp;the pessimistic camp. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view&nbsp;&mdash; as&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrote <a title="Does Economic Growth Require a Growing Population?" href="http://www.adamalthus.com/?p=114" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;&mdash; we&rsquo;re unlikely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;use historic models to&nbsp;predict future patterns. The combination of&nbsp;complete manufacturing automation with other digital services&nbsp;&mdash; sensors, 3D printing etc. &mdash;&nbsp;create such a&nbsp;disruption that the economy will not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;adjust in&nbsp;the short period over which this transition takes place.

Economies whose populations continue to&nbsp;grow will see an&nbsp;increasing divide between the digital literates who benefit and control&nbsp;&mdash; and can exploit&nbsp;&mdash; this automated manufacturing and services infrastructure and those who are displaced by&nbsp;it. The alternative path sees populations shrinking as&nbsp;new wealth generated by&nbsp;this next generation of&nbsp;automation drives down fertility rates. Both of&nbsp;these paths come with their own problems. The only sure thing&nbsp;&mdash; at&nbsp;least for the next decade&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;the inexorable rise computational power which will be&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;ever greater levels of&nbsp;automation. A&nbsp;major dislocation of&nbsp;manufacturing employment patterns it&nbsp;coming. The question is&nbsp;how we&rsquo;ll handle the dislocation it&nbsp;drives?
