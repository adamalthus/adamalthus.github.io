The Office of&nbsp;Governor Bob McDonnell of&nbsp;Virginia issued a <a title="Virginia Press Release" href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/news/viewRelease.cfm?id=323" target="_blank">press release</a> today trumpetting their success in&nbsp;convincing Microsoft to&nbsp;build its latest Gen4 Data Center in&nbsp;the state. Given huge gulf between the real long-term local economic benefit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;data center like this and the content of&nbsp;the press release I&nbsp;am&nbsp;left to&nbsp;conclude that either A) The Governor really does not understand the economics of&nbsp;these things or B) He&nbsp;really does understand the true economic impact and the press release is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cynical attempt to&nbsp;fool the voters.

For other politicians who might be&nbsp;tempted to&nbsp;spend tax payers money to&nbsp;secure the locations of&nbsp;a&nbsp;data center here are some things you really do&nbsp;need to&nbsp;understand:

  1. Today&rsquo;s modern global data centers do&nbsp;not create any meaningful number of&nbsp;jobs. Modern global data centers are remotely operated which means that even the few jobs that are created are not high skilled software or&nbsp;computer engineering roles. The type of&nbsp;jobs created tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in the building maintenance, HVAC, electrical engineering and security domains.
  2. There&rsquo;s a&nbsp;high price to&nbsp;be&nbsp;paid for securing relatively few jobs. The fifty number touted by&nbsp;Virginia sounds about right. However, from the Governor&rsquo;s press release, it&nbsp;sounds like at&nbsp;least $6.9 Million of&nbsp;direct incentives and probably an&nbsp;unspecified amount of&nbsp;long-term commercial property tax exemptions were used to&nbsp;secure those 50 jobs. Is&nbsp;that a&nbsp;good rate of&nbsp;return?
  3. When a&nbsp;technology company says they will invest $499 Million in&nbsp;building a&nbsp;new data center that does not mean they are investing $499 Million in&nbsp;your state. Far from&nbsp;it. Most of&nbsp;that cost will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the computing infrastructure, communications, and other electrical machinery. That equipment is&nbsp;by&nbsp;and large not built in&nbsp;the state where the data center will be&nbsp;located. In&nbsp;fact a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;sourced from outside the country creating jobs and employment elsewhere, but not in&nbsp;your state.
  4. Modern data centers are 'Shells' of&nbsp;a&nbsp;building. Microsoft&rsquo;s Gen 4 data centers employ pre-assembled container 'Lego Blocks' which are rolled onto a&nbsp;concrete slab and plugged into power, cooling and data pipes. If&nbsp;they could get away without building anything other than the concrete slab and HVAC containment buildings they would and in&nbsp;years to&nbsp;come they will. This all means that very few construction jobs will be&nbsp;created and certainly not any that require significant new up-skilling of&nbsp;your labor force.
  5. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;positive note a&nbsp;modern global data center is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most dense power consumption facilities around. That is&nbsp;why many sites are selected based on&nbsp;access to&nbsp;hydro-power where the cost of&nbsp;energy and distribution challenges can be&nbsp;kept to&nbsp;a&nbsp;minimum. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible that the location of&nbsp;a&nbsp;major global data center in&nbsp;Virginia will create the downstream need to&nbsp;upgrade the state&rsquo;s electricity distribution and generation infrastructure. Being forced to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this obviously creates ancillary benefits for other company&rsquo;s but again at&nbsp;what price?

Politicians really do&nbsp;need to&nbsp;understand the reality of&nbsp;these things. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;far too easy to&nbsp;give away the tax payers money today on&nbsp;the assumption of&nbsp;major downstream economic benefits tomorrow. In&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;data centers those benefits are likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;few and far between.
