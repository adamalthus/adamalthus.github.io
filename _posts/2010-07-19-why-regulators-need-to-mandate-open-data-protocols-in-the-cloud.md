TechCrunch&rsquo;s <a title="TechCrunch" href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/19/quicken-online-users-saw-the-bait-took-the-switch-to-mint-com-and-are-left-with-nothing/" target="_blank">article</a> about Intuit&rsquo;s decision to&nbsp;shut down Quicken OnLine and not let users migrate their data to&nbsp;the new service Mint.com is&nbsp;an&nbsp;outstanding example of&nbsp;the emerging problem of 'Data Lock-In' and an&nbsp;issue which regulators need to&nbsp;get ahead of&nbsp;before its too late.

As&nbsp;the market for 'Cloud' services takes off we&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;witness an&nbsp;explosion of&nbsp;new services whose value proposition is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;managing some aspects of&nbsp;the consumers life on-line. The big buckets already are life-centric services such as&nbsp;health and fitness, personal finances and of&nbsp;course managing you social graph. The expanding roster of&nbsp;new services will be&nbsp;accompanied by&nbsp;an&nbsp;equally large number of&nbsp;failures. That is&nbsp;the natural order of&nbsp;things in&nbsp;new markets. Not all new entrants will find a&nbsp;business model which works or&nbsp;is&nbsp;sustainable over the long term. Regulators need to&nbsp;start thinking about the consumer protection regimes that need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;put in&nbsp;place as&nbsp;this happens.

I&nbsp;was struck by&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the debate surrounding the Intuit issue by&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;folks who think its not a&nbsp;big deal because Quicken On-Line is a 'Free' service. That could not be&nbsp;further off the mark. One of&nbsp;the challenges for any new entrant in&nbsp;the crowded market for 'Cloud' services will be&nbsp;figuring out how to&nbsp;make their service as 'Sticky' as&nbsp;possible. After having invested a&nbsp;great deal to&nbsp;acquire new customers you want to&nbsp;make sure its not easy for them to&nbsp;leave or&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;a&nbsp;competitors service (Ever wonder why its incredibly difficult to&nbsp;dump you mobile provider? It&rsquo;s called 'Churn' and 'ARPU')

One way to&nbsp;build 'Stickiness' is&nbsp;to&nbsp;ensure that new customers have to&nbsp;invest a&nbsp;significant amount of&nbsp;personal effort to&nbsp;extract the full benefits of&nbsp;the service. In&nbsp;Quicken Online&rsquo;s case that was the time required to&nbsp;upload banking information and months and months of&nbsp;entering individual financial transactions. Making it&nbsp;easy for customers to&nbsp;export their data from the service would undermine 'Stickiness' and therefore increase the likely hood that customers might switch to&nbsp;a&nbsp;competitor&rsquo;s services. In&nbsp;the highly competitive 'Cloud' service market it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;very tempting to&nbsp;find ways to&nbsp;bind users to&nbsp;services by&nbsp;making it&nbsp;difficult for them to&nbsp;take their data and run.

Consumers need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;educated about the dangers of 'Data Lock-In' so&nbsp;that they increasingly demand Open Data Access (ODA) from 'Cloud' service providers. I&nbsp;think its also about time that government regulators started thinking about mandating ODA for all service providers. These regulations would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural extension of&nbsp;existing privacy regulations by&nbsp;enshrining the principle that personal information of&nbsp;any sort belongs to&nbsp;the consumer, not the provider, and the consumer has the right to&nbsp;take that data with them when they leave a&nbsp;service. This would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;direct analog to 'Number Portability' requirements in&nbsp;the mobile telephony sector. Service providers would be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;ensure that all consumer owned data can be&nbsp;exported from their service using open standard formats and protocols.

Such a&nbsp;regulatory requirement would protect consumers of&nbsp;the sort of&nbsp;mess now faced by&nbsp;Inuit&rsquo;s customers. It&nbsp;would also force service providers to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;broader value proposition of&nbsp;their service rather than relying on 'Data Lock-In' as&nbsp;a&nbsp;competitive lever. This focus on 'Functional' competition would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great thing for consumers and the market.
