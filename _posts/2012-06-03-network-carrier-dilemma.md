This <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/phillipkeys/2012/05/31/network-equipment-manufacturers-try-to-help-out-mobile-carriers/" target="_blank">article</a> in&nbsp;Forbes magazine about network equipment providers enabling network carriers to&nbsp;expose service APIs (Application Programing Interfaces) started an&nbsp;interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanmurray/status/209309211614642176" target="_blank">debate</a> with Alcatel-Lucent's Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/magicmerl" target="_blank">@magicmerl</a>), Mike Maney (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/the_spinmd" target="_blank">@the_spinmd</a>) and others on&nbsp;Twitter.

The crux of&nbsp;the debate is&nbsp;whether exposing developer APIs at&nbsp;the network layer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good or&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad thing. This is&nbsp;the latest round in&nbsp;the 'dumb pipes vs. smart network' debate which lies at&nbsp;the heart of&nbsp;an&nbsp;economic dilemma facing the network carrier business model.<!--more-->

Value in&nbsp;the internet economic model is&nbsp;being extracted by&nbsp;the likes of&nbsp;Google, Microsoft, Facebook, EBay, Amazon et. al. &mdash;&nbsp;not by&nbsp;the network providers.

Network carriers increasingly provide only one service that consumers value&nbsp;&mdash; moving bits from point A&nbsp;to&nbsp;point B. Competition&nbsp;&mdash; at&nbsp;least outside the US&nbsp;&mdash; makes 'bit delivery' a&nbsp;commodity business with pricing models to&nbsp;match. Downward pricing pressure on&nbsp;the commoditized 'bit delivery' business model stands in&nbsp;stark contrast to&nbsp;the ever greater capital investment required to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;with growing bandwidth demands. Bluntly the equation does not compute and something will have to&nbsp;give.

What does all of&nbsp;this have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with APIs? In&nbsp;short network carriers see the provision of&nbsp;APIs as&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;extract value from further up&nbsp;the internet food chain. APIs are the mechanism through which developers embed services in&nbsp;the apps they write for consumers. APIs make it&nbsp;more likely that developers will consume new network services that carriers create. Carriers can then generate incremental revenue from consumers that use the service embedded&nbsp;&mdash; through the API&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;the applications developers create.

Creating unique services&nbsp;&mdash; that are differentiated from those offered by&nbsp;other carriers&nbsp;&mdash; opens the opportunity to&nbsp;control pricing and therefore how much value can be&nbsp;extracted. The downside is&nbsp;that applications consuming these services through their APIs would be&nbsp;carrier specific. The app on&nbsp;your smartphone would only work with the particular carrier offering that unique service. That would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;major problem.

Network specific applications would fracture the internet&rsquo;s universal access model by&nbsp;partitioning the internet into carrier controlled 'service gardens.' That&rsquo;s an&nbsp;alarming possibility and one that most believers in&nbsp;network neutrality and most consumers would find very unappealing.

The alternative would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;ensure that any network service and associated API is&nbsp;universally available across all carriers networks. The <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4x3tXDUL8h2VAQAURh_Yw!!?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Releases_2012/News_Article_002637.xml" target="_blank">YouConnect</a> service enabled by&nbsp;Alcatel-Lucent and referenced in&nbsp;the Forbes article applies just such a&nbsp;model. Unfortunately such 'Universal' services are unlikely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;economically appealing to&nbsp;the carriers.

Services that are 'Universally' available across all carrier networks will significantly limit the ability of&nbsp;one carrier to&nbsp;differentiate their service offerings from anyone other carrier&rsquo;s. This lack of&nbsp;differentiation eliminates competitive leverage and leads directly to&nbsp;commoditization of&nbsp;the service and a&nbsp;return to&nbsp;the downward pricing spiral witnessed in&nbsp;today&rsquo;s 'bit moving' business model.

In&nbsp;short&nbsp;&mdash; carrier specific services and APIs risk undermining the very thing which gives the internet its utility: universality of&nbsp;access. On&nbsp;the other hand universal services are difficult to&nbsp;differentiate and are likely to&nbsp;become commoditized with a&nbsp;resultant lack of&nbsp;carrier pricing power. Neither of&nbsp;these alternatives solves the fundamental economic problem lying at&nbsp;the heart of&nbsp;the network carrier business model.
