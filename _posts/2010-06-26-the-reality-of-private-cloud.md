Mary-Jo Foley posted a&nbsp;provocative <a title="Who is pushing the private cloud: Users or vendors?" href="http://bit.ly/acGNH5" target="_blank">article</a> yesterday about the reality of 'Private Cloud' offerings and who is&nbsp;driving the demand; customers or&nbsp;vendors?

As&nbsp;I&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the people responsible for designing Microsoft&rsquo;s Public Sector 'Cloud' strategy I&nbsp;have some opinions about this issue which I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;share.

It&rsquo;s fair to&nbsp;say that until we&nbsp;started looking at&nbsp;the worldwide customer requirements for 'Cloud' in&nbsp;the public sector the whole issue of 'Private Clouds' was not a&nbsp;major part of&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s overall 'Cloud' strategy. However, once you start looking at&nbsp;the requirements of&nbsp;public sector organizations outside the&nbsp;US you very quickly realize that standard 'Public Cloud' offerings will not cut it.

The majority of&nbsp;foreign governments have data sovereignty regulations which prohibit the storage and transport of&nbsp;data beyond the country&rsquo;s borders. Many governments also have very serious concerns about the reach and implications of&nbsp;the&nbsp;US Patriot Act which requires any&nbsp;US based 'Cloud' provider to&nbsp;disclose any data held within their systems to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US Government, upon request, no&nbsp;matter where that data is&nbsp;stored. Obviously these requirements do&nbsp;not affect the provision of 'Cloud' services to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US government. However, providers will still need to&nbsp;ensure that&nbsp;US government data is&nbsp;not 'Smeared' across the provider&rsquo;s global 'Cloud' infrastructure and is&nbsp;instead kept within data centers hosted in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US.

On&nbsp;face value these requirements might be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete barrier to&nbsp;the adoption of 'Cloud' by&nbsp;foreign governments. However, these challenges are balanced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge pressure to&nbsp;improve the efficiency of&nbsp;IT provision across the Public Sector. The extreme budgetary pressure being faced by&nbsp;many governments is&nbsp;forcing a&nbsp;re-evaluations of&nbsp;how&nbsp;IT services are delivered and at&nbsp;what costs. In&nbsp;this light the costs advantages of 'Cloud'; scale, elastic and automated provisioning, pay-as-you-go, reduction in&nbsp;capital expenditure and consolidation of&nbsp;operations etc. are all highly attractive.

The only way to 'Square the Circle' is&nbsp;to&nbsp;offer a 'Private Cloud' solution i.e. a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;technologies which will let governments implement&nbsp;IT infrastructure which has 'Cloud' attributes but which can be&nbsp;kept separate from the 'Public Cloud' infrastructure and compliant with the country&rsquo;s required policy, regulatory and security regimes.

The&nbsp;UK is a <a title="UK G-Cloud" href="http://bit.ly/caMDUU" target="_blank">good example</a>. The&nbsp;UK government is&nbsp;expecting all the advantages of 'Cloud' without the exposure of&nbsp;putting&nbsp;UK government data into the 'Public Cloud' infrastructure with all the exposure that implies. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day 'Cloud' is&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular approach to&nbsp;systems and workload 'Management' that delivers the benefits I&rsquo;ve outlined above. Whether these benefits are delivered within a&nbsp;private datacenter or&nbsp;across a&nbsp;public infrastructure is&nbsp;really immaterial.

From a&nbsp;competitive perspective its also important to&nbsp;understand why players like Amazon and Google want to&nbsp;play down the relevance of 'Private Cloud'. The public sector is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very large and important&nbsp;IT market. In&nbsp;many countries the government is&nbsp;the single largest spender on&nbsp;IT. Vendors who only offer 'Public Cloud' services are failing to&nbsp;meet the most basic needs of&nbsp;public sector customers outside the&nbsp;US. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;the public sector market around the world you will need both a 'Public' and 'Private Cloud' strategy.

It&nbsp;was interesting to&nbsp;see that having driven this set of&nbsp;requirements out of&nbsp;the public sector side of&nbsp;the business the concept of 'Private Cloud' started to&nbsp;find significant traction in&nbsp;the enterprise segment. There are plenty of&nbsp;large private sector companies who are not yet ready to&nbsp;move their sensitive data into the 'Public Cloud' and yet want the benefits of 'Cloud' workload management to&nbsp;drive efficiency in&nbsp;their&nbsp;IT service provision. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view most large enterprise organizations will end up&nbsp;using a&nbsp;blend of&nbsp;both 'Public' and 'Private' cloud.
