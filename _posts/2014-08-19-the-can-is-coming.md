In&nbsp;scenarios where large data-sets are being processed it&nbsp;is&nbsp;almost always cheaper to&nbsp;move computation to&nbsp;the data than the other way round. My&nbsp;friend and former colleague Dave McCrory nicely captured this reality in&nbsp;his concept of <a href="http://blog.mccrory.me/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/" target="_blank">Data Gravity</a>.Today's cloud based computing architectures assume that _all_ data will flow to&nbsp;the center to&nbsp;be&nbsp;processed. Unfortunately, this centralized data-processing model is&nbsp;not likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;economically viable as&nbsp;we&nbsp;look forward to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tsunami of&nbsp;data being generated by&nbsp;trillions of&nbsp;connected devices and sensors.

In&nbsp;the brave new world of&nbsp;the 'Internet of&nbsp;Things' - IoT&nbsp;&mdash; moving every bit of&nbsp;generated data from edge devices to&nbsp;the center for processing will likely make little economic sense. A&nbsp;new distributed data processing architecture is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;required.

Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) are a&nbsp;common way of&nbsp;efficiently moving data from the center to&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the network but a&nbsp;new generation of&nbsp;Content Aggregation Networks (CANs) may be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;make the processing of&nbsp;IoT data economically viable&nbsp;&mdash; is&nbsp;there a 'CAN' in&nbsp;your future?

<!--more-->

Content Distribution Networks&nbsp;&mdash; CDNs are frequently used to&nbsp;get data out to&nbsp;edge devices with the most efficiency and cost effectiveness. A&nbsp;CDN acts an&nbsp;efficient distribution network for data accessed by&nbsp;end users&nbsp;&mdash; html, css, scripts, audio, video etc. &mdash;&nbsp;all the stuff that ends up&nbsp;being rendered by&nbsp;our browsers and media players. CDN&rsquo;s move large volumes of&nbsp;this data from the center out&nbsp;&mdash; through high capacity, low cost, pipes&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;local 'Points-of-Presence' which are geographically close to&nbsp;the end user. This model allows for economically efficient distribution while at&nbsp;the same time greatly improves the end user experience by&nbsp;reducing the time to&nbsp;serve individual user requests.

Overcoming the economic challenges of&nbsp;transferring huge volumes of&nbsp;IoT generated data are likely to&nbsp;need network distribution architectures that work like CDNs _in&nbsp;reverse_. In&nbsp;effect we&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;need a&nbsp;new generation of 'Content Aggregation Networks' (CAN). A&nbsp;CAN will compliment a&nbsp;CDN by&nbsp;optimizing the flow of&nbsp;data from edge devices to&nbsp;cloud based processing in&nbsp;the center. But what sets that apart from standard networking technology and topologies that make up&nbsp;today&rsquo;s&nbsp;IP network? In&nbsp;two words: Computation and Filtering.

In&nbsp;an&nbsp;IoT connected world it&nbsp;will make little sense to&nbsp;move every bit of&nbsp;data generated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;sensor&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;edge device&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;the center for processing. The primary role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;CAN will be&nbsp;to&nbsp;distribute tiered computational processing and filters across the network including to&nbsp;the edge devices. Just like the supplier network of&nbsp;a&nbsp;large manufacturing company the CAN will ensure that data gets processed where it&nbsp;makes sense and only 'value-added' bits are allowed to&nbsp;flow towards the center. In&nbsp;essence a&nbsp;CAN will enable architects to&nbsp;assign a&nbsp;relative economic value to&nbsp;each bit and only then allow those bits which justify the cost of&nbsp;transport to&nbsp;flow upstream.

In&nbsp;a&nbsp;CAN enabled architecture an&nbsp;environmental sensor might only send bits across the network when a&nbsp;detected signal crosses some % value above ambient. The CAN would be&nbsp;responsible for distributing the the computation and threshold filter algorithms to&nbsp;the sensors across the network. Even when threshold is&nbsp;crossed it&nbsp;might not make economic sense to&nbsp;flow data all the way to&nbsp;the center for processing. Instead the CAN would provision a&nbsp;data processing node close&nbsp;&mdash; an&nbsp;edge computing instance&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;the sensor network so&nbsp;that aggregate sensor data can be&nbsp;locally analyzed. Only the analytic product from this local processing may eventually flow to&nbsp;the center.

Our current generation of 'Big Data' processing infrastructures&nbsp;&mdash; such a&nbsp;Hadoop&nbsp;&mdash; use a&nbsp;distributed architecture where computation is&nbsp;distributed across a&nbsp;number of 'compute nodes' which then act on&nbsp;local subsets of&nbsp;data. From one perspective a&nbsp;CAN could be&nbsp;thought of&nbsp;as a&nbsp;network wide version of&nbsp;the same architecture. However, a&nbsp;CAN would also be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;initiate edge computing instances on&nbsp;demand and to&nbsp;provide distributed cost modelling and filtering mechanisms to&nbsp;optimize the downstream flow of&nbsp;data towards the center in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cloud based computing environment.

The competitive landscape for CANs appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wide open at&nbsp;the moment but there&rsquo;s some indication that this will soon change. The major cloud service providers&nbsp;&mdash; Amazon, Google and Microsoft&nbsp;&mdash; are likely to&nbsp;see this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;major opportunity but the need to&nbsp;distribute computation to&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the network will challenge their existing infrastructure and business models.

The opportunity to&nbsp;move up&nbsp;the value chain with CANs is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;far too compelling for Cisco to&nbsp;let the opportunity pass them&nbsp;by. Cisco have been looking for a&nbsp;rational to&nbsp;exploit the distributed computational fabric of&nbsp;their router business for years. The CAN opportunity may be&nbsp;just the ticket.

The existing Hadoop and 'Big Data' processing players are also likely candidates seeing CANs as&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural extension of&nbsp;their existing distributed data processing architectures but its difficult to&nbsp;see how any of&nbsp;them could reach the scale to&nbsp;be&nbsp;relevant unless in&nbsp;partnership with one of&nbsp;the big infrastructure players.

For the highly distributed computational CAN model to&nbsp;achieve global scale we&rsquo;re also going to&nbsp;need a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;standards. Will we&nbsp;see the emergence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;common&nbsp;&mdash; interoperable&nbsp;&mdash; standard for the distribution of&nbsp;computational algorithms, filters and cost models across highly distributed infrastructures&nbsp;&mdash; including to&nbsp;the most microscopic of&nbsp;end-point sensor nodes? I&nbsp;hope so, because without these standards and a&nbsp;new generation of&nbsp;CAN architectures&nbsp;&mdash; and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world with a&nbsp;growing deluge of&nbsp;IoT data&nbsp;&mdash; economically sifting the signal from the noise is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;close to&nbsp;impossible.
