        <h2>
          The Services Transformation and the algorithmic revolution
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          A&nbsp;fundamental, multi-tiered transformation of&nbsp;services is&nbsp;underway. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;so pervasive and of&nbsp;such scope that it&nbsp;entails a&nbsp;transformation of&nbsp;global competitive economics. First of&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dynamic in&nbsp;the global economy, which not only adds to&nbsp;the relative growth of&nbsp;services, but leads to&nbsp;most businesses integrating a&nbsp;services component into their business model. Secondly, the very nature of&nbsp;services is&nbsp;being transformed, driven by&nbsp;developments in&nbsp;Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools, the uses to&nbsp;which they are being put, and the networks on&nbsp;which they run. Finally, there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;emerging strategic challenge for services companies that are using ICT to&nbsp;ad- dress the classical productivity challenge in&nbsp;services, concerning the need to&nbsp;avoid commoditization.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The consequences of&nbsp;this fundamental transformation of&nbsp;services impact the nature and the distribution of&nbsp;jobs globally; they change the strategic requirements for success in&nbsp;all kinds of&nbsp;businesses and they pose significant new challenges for economic policy.

          In&nbsp;this <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Services-Dilemma-book.pdf" target="_blank">white book</a>, we&nbsp;will map the entirety of&nbsp;the services transformation and its implication for services innovation. We&nbsp;will be&nbsp;discussing the strategic business choices that are being posed&mdash;in some core sections and case studies with a&nbsp;particular focus on&nbsp;smaller services companies&mdash;as well as&nbsp;some key public policy challenges.
