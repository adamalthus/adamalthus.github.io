Nick Eaton&rsquo;s Microsoft blog for the Seattle&nbsp;PI <a title="Nick Eaton Seattle PI" href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/213932.asp?source=rss" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday that Microsoft&rsquo;s CEO Steve Ballmer would once again be&nbsp;giving the opening keynote at&nbsp;the Consumer Electronics Show in&nbsp;Las Vegas on&nbsp;January 5th 2011. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion having Steve open CES is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strategic error on&nbsp;the part of&nbsp;the company.

Microsoft has a&nbsp;perception problem; It&nbsp;is&nbsp;viewed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;consumer company when at&nbsp;its heart it&nbsp;is&nbsp;really an&nbsp;enterprise platforms company. For over ten years that mistaken assumption has depressed the stock price, caused the company to&nbsp;set expectations that his has failed to&nbsp;deliver on&nbsp;and has massively undervalued the assets of&nbsp;the company.

The sad thing about this &laquo;Crisis in&nbsp;Perception&raquo; is&nbsp;that its largely of&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s own making. Microsoft&rsquo;s global brand marketing and&nbsp;PR engines continue to&nbsp;promote the false view of&nbsp;Microsoft as&nbsp;a&nbsp;consumer company. Lifestyle commercials like the &laquo;<a title="Microsoft I'm a PC" href="http://gizmodo.com/5052051/microsofts-im-a-pc-ad-beats-seinfeld-but-not-hodgman" target="_blank">I&rsquo;m a&nbsp;PC</a>&raquo; campaign would be&nbsp;perfect coming from a&nbsp;Coca Cola or&nbsp;Nike. Coming from Microsoft they very dangerously reinforce a&nbsp;mistaken impression of&nbsp;what Microsoft&nbsp;is. Steve Ballmer standing on&nbsp;stage at&nbsp;the 'Consumer' Electronics Show does exactly the same.

You would have thought the company would have learned their lesson from the&nbsp;PR mess which followed Steve showcasing HP&rsquo;s slate computer during last year&rsquo;s CES keynote. You need no&nbsp;other evidence to&nbsp;understand just how much Microsoft is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;consumer company. Steve was set up&nbsp;to&nbsp;use the&nbsp;HP slate as&nbsp;a&nbsp;counter to&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s expected launch of&nbsp;the iPad. Within six months the <a title="HP Slate Canceled" href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/another-tablet-falls-hp-slate-canceled-0500/" target="_blank">HP&nbsp;Slate was canceled</a>, HP&nbsp;was <a title="HP Buys Palms Assets" href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2010/100428xa.html" target="_blank">buying Palms assets</a> and the iPad became the <a title="Apple iPad fastest selling conusmer device" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/handheld/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224701051" target="_blank">fastest selling consumer device in&nbsp;history</a>. Where did that leave Microsoft; looking ridiculous, even less clear about its counter strategy to&nbsp;Apple and still dependent on&nbsp;partners who can and will change their loyalties at&nbsp;the drop of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hat.

There&rsquo;s only one scenario under which I&nbsp;would have Steve get up&nbsp;on&nbsp;stage at&nbsp;CES in&nbsp;2011: If&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;unveil a&nbsp;branded, clearly class leading computing device in&nbsp;which they control the complete end-to-end consumer experience. If&nbsp;that is&nbsp;not what the company is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;talk about then anything else is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;putting just one more nail in&nbsp;the coffin.
