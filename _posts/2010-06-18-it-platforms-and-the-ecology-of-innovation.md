It&nbsp;has been fun being back in&nbsp;Beijing this week. My&nbsp;first visit to&nbsp;the city was in&nbsp;1989 when the streets were still filled with bicycles. I&rsquo;ve been back here about once a&nbsp;year since then yet the pace of&nbsp;progress on&nbsp;so&nbsp;many levels is&nbsp;still hard to&nbsp;comprehend. Growth of&nbsp;the 'Starbucks Index' alone is&nbsp;mind blowing and seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reaching Seattle or&nbsp;New York densities. The other thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is&nbsp;the incredible focus on&nbsp;efficiency; from the three hour turn-around for a&nbsp;visa at&nbsp;the Chinese Consulate in&nbsp;Zurich (Try that at&nbsp;the&nbsp;US Embassy), to&nbsp;the immigration process and flow through the airport. Yes, the traffic is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;nightmare and seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;getting worse. I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t live here so&nbsp;I&nbsp;can imagine there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;alternate reality I&rsquo;m not aware&nbsp;of. However, the general experience for visitors is&nbsp;pretty impressive.

I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;with Microsoft&rsquo;s National Technology Officer Sean Zhang on&nbsp;Wednesday for a&nbsp;great evening of&nbsp;conversation. I&rsquo;ll also be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see Peter Moore and Michael Thatcher before I&nbsp;leave so&nbsp;that&rsquo;s an&nbsp;added bonus.

The reason for the visit to&nbsp;Beijing was an&nbsp;invitation to&nbsp;present at&nbsp;the <a title="Chinese Academy of Governance" href="http://www.nsa.gov.cn" target="_blank">Chinese Academy of&nbsp;Governance</a> today. The Academy is&nbsp;responsible for training senior civil servants in&nbsp;the PRC administration. My&nbsp;presentation is&nbsp;titled &laquo;IT&nbsp;Platforms and the Ecology of&nbsp;Innovation&raquo; (<a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IT-Platforms-and-The-Ecology-of-Innovation-China-V5.pdf" target="_blank">PDF copy here</a>) and focuses on&nbsp;the how the evolution of&nbsp;IT platforms has enabled the development of&nbsp;the global service economy. I&rsquo;ll take a&nbsp;historic look at&nbsp;how these platforms have evolved and then will talk about the coming disruptive effects of&nbsp;the 'Cloud' platform and those which follow.

This is&nbsp;presentation comes out of&nbsp;ongoing work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zysman" target="_blank">Prof. John Zysman</a> and the team at [UC&nbsp;Berkeley&rsquo;s BRIE](http://brie.berkeley.edu/). One of&nbsp;the things which is&nbsp;central but still the center of&nbsp;a&nbsp;heated debate is&nbsp;how you define an&nbsp;IT Platform i.e. rigorously enough for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be used as&nbsp;an&nbsp;analytical definition when looking at&nbsp;the surrounding political economy issues. The current definition I&rsquo;m using is:

> A&nbsp;consistent development environment supported by&nbsp;new software and hardware architectures, based on&nbsp;standards and available at&nbsp;scale, that enables service and business model innovation

This is&nbsp;not perfect and I&rsquo;m open to&nbsp;suggestions about how to&nbsp;improve&nbsp;it. Any definition needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;delineate historic platform transitions in&nbsp;a&nbsp;clear and defensible way and also be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;help identify when a&nbsp;new transition is&nbsp;taking place.

I&rsquo;m looking forward to&nbsp;a&nbsp;interesting discussion and debate about the opportunities and policy challenges these new platforms will create in&nbsp;the Chinese context. Should be&nbsp;fun.
