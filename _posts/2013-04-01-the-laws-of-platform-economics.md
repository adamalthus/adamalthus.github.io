The economic evolution of&nbsp;computing platforms appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;guided by&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of 'Laws' that are independent of&nbsp;any specific underlying technology. These 'Laws' help explain the evolutionary trajectory of&nbsp;mature platforms and can act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;predictor for the trajectory of&nbsp;emerging platforms and behaviors of&nbsp;those that control them.

The first three laws of&nbsp;platform economics are: _Value always migrates up&nbsp;the stack, _Value gets integrated over time, _Those that control platform evolution get to&nbsp;define how value is&nbsp;extracted.___ A&nbsp;definition of&nbsp;each of&nbsp;the 'Laws' is&nbsp;provided below: <!--more-->

__**First Law&nbsp;&mdash;** _Value always migrates up&nbsp;the stack_&nbsp;&mdash; Value creating functionality which starts off embedded in&nbsp;silicon or&nbsp;hardware functionality will eventually migrate to&nbsp;software. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform matures value will be&nbsp;driven by&nbsp;software functionality that is&nbsp;increasingly abstracted from any specific underlying physical implementation. The canonical example of&nbsp;this law is&nbsp;the networking stack: Highly specialized network routing silicon gives way to&nbsp;specialized router operating systems which eventually give way to&nbsp;software defined networking layers in&nbsp;cloud computing fabrics.

**Second Law** _&mdash;&nbsp;Value gets integrated over time_ &mdash;&nbsp;Functionality which adds value to&nbsp;computing platforms will&nbsp;&mdash; if&nbsp;it&nbsp;initially sits outside the control of&nbsp;those that develop the platform&nbsp;&mdash; be&nbsp;integrated into the platform. The greater the economic value the more likely that external functions will get absorbed and integrated. In&nbsp;the early days of&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows platform many valuable functions were provided by&nbsp;3rd party software&nbsp;&mdash; TCP/IP networking protocols, memory managers and anti-virus software to&nbsp;name three examples. Over time these functions were integrated to&nbsp;further enhance the value of&nbsp;the platform.

**Third Law&nbsp;&mdash;** _Those that control platform evolution get to&nbsp;define how value is&nbsp;extracted&nbsp;&mdash;_ In&nbsp;other words the owner/developer of&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform will always act in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that enhances the platform&rsquo;s primary driver of&nbsp;economic value. Google will always make platform decisions that enhance its digital advertising based revenue model. The functionality of&nbsp;iOS will evolve to&nbsp;enhance Apples ability sell hardware and to&nbsp;extract value from consumers use of&nbsp;services and consumption of&nbsp;media. Microsoft chooses to&nbsp;implement 'Do Not Track' by&nbsp;default in&nbsp;IE 10 to&nbsp;both undermine Google&rsquo;s advertising based business model and to&nbsp;enhance the attractiveness of&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s new device and services business model. Red Hat is&nbsp;the only open source platform company generating more than $1Billion in&nbsp;revenue per year.
