Last week saw a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;speculation regarding Microsoft&rsquo;s possible acquisition of&nbsp;Nokia&rsquo;s mobile devices business. The rumor was quashed by&nbsp;Stephen Elop <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/ericsavitz/2011/06/01/d9-nokia-ceo-elop-flat-out-denies-rumors-microsoft-to-buy-hardware-unit%2F" target="_blank">speaking at&nbsp;the All Things D</a> conference who denied there had been any discussion with Microsoft regarding an&nbsp;acquisition. Case closed then? Maybe not.

It&nbsp;is&nbsp;obvious just how strategically important the Microsoft deal is&nbsp;for Nokia. Its not overstating the situation to&nbsp;say that Nokia&rsquo;s very survival and a&nbsp;major mobile handset vendor hinges on&nbsp;how effectively the transition to&nbsp;Windows Phone 7 is&nbsp;handled and how successful the resulting Nokia/Microsoft products are in&nbsp;the market place. There is&nbsp;little or&nbsp;no&nbsp;room for error.

While the same can not be&nbsp;said about Microsoft&nbsp;&mdash; the company is&nbsp;certainly not going to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;business if&nbsp;the Nokia deal doesn&rsquo;t pan out&nbsp;&mdash; In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view Steve Ballmer&rsquo;s continued ability to&nbsp;bring the Microsoft board along with him on&nbsp;this windows phone investment binge does depend on&nbsp;Nokia&rsquo;s success. Only Nokia can deliver WP7 the volume it&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;viewed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;viable third alternative in&nbsp;the smartphone operating system business&nbsp;&mdash; I&rsquo;m sticking by&nbsp;my&nbsp;previous <a href=" http://www.adamalthus.com/2011/01/sinofskys-power-play/" target="_blank">prediction</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;paltry 1.25M WP7 unit sales to&nbsp;date. Nokia is&nbsp;being given &laquo;First among equals&raquo; status in&nbsp;the smartphone device manufacturer ecosystem because the future of&nbsp;Ballmer&rsquo;s phone strategy&nbsp;&mdash; and perhaps his very position&nbsp;&mdash; depends on&nbsp;Nokia&rsquo;s success.

[**Update:** 6/6/2011&nbsp;&mdash; At&nbsp;last week&rsquo;s <a href="http://allthingsd.com/" target="_blank">All Things D</a> conference AT&T's CEO Ralph De&nbsp;La&nbsp;Vega says that <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110604/exclusive-atts-ralph-de-la-vega-on-which-smartphones-are-winning/" target="_blank">Windows Phone sales have not be&nbsp;living up&nbsp;to&nbsp;expectations</a>.]

Last weeks <a href="http://investors.nokia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=107224&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1569385&highlight=" target="_blank">announcement</a> by&nbsp;Nokia that it&nbsp;would miss its second quarter forecast and that its business was now so&nbsp;unpredictable that it&nbsp;could not offer any new forecasts for the rest of&nbsp;2011. The street dealt swiftly with that news by&nbsp;whacking 20% off Nokia&rsquo;s stock price. That brings Nokia&rsquo;s market cap down to&nbsp;around $24B. That&rsquo;s 45% off its its peak in&nbsp;February 2011. Microsoft&rsquo;s stock has trended in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very similar fashion since the Nokia deal was announced and took a&nbsp;sympathetic hit last week when Nokia warned. Both companies stock prices have been on&nbsp;the road to&nbsp;nowhere since the deal was announced but its the precipitous decline in&nbsp;Nokia&rsquo;s stock price which should make Microsoft stock holders very worried. The reality is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;Nokia&rsquo;s valuation continues to&nbsp;decline then Ballmer and team may be&nbsp;forced into acquiring Nokia.

At&nbsp;some price&nbsp;&mdash; not too far away from where it&nbsp;stands today&nbsp;&mdash; Nokia will&nbsp;&mdash; unavoidably&nbsp;&mdash; become a&nbsp;active takeover target. I&rsquo;ll bet there are enough block shareholders who are disenchanted enough with Elop and Microsoft&rsquo;s strategy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;dying to&nbsp;dump their stock for the right premium. Nokia&rsquo;s <a href="http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/Ratios.jsp?tkr=nok" target="_blank">book value stands at $5.37</a> and its closing stock price on&nbsp;Friday last week was $6.66. That&rsquo;s way to&nbsp;close for comfort. Any further decline in&nbsp;the stock price and Elop&rsquo;s days of&nbsp;being in&nbsp;control of&nbsp;Nokia&rsquo;s destiny look numbered. Once the serious 3rd party acquisition discussions start Ballmer will be&nbsp;left with two very unpalatable choices: either let Nokia be&nbsp;acquired and risk the unravelling of&nbsp;the entire Nokia strategy&nbsp;&mdash; killing any hopes for Microsoft&rsquo;s mobile strategy in&nbsp;the process&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;acquire Nokia&nbsp;&mdash; acting as&nbsp;&laquo;White Knight&raquo;&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;prevent the company falling into unfriendly hands; an&nbsp;act which would destroy the very core of&nbsp;Microsoft multi-OEM mobile business model.

Given Ballmer&rsquo;s fanatical commitment to&nbsp;making sure Microsoft remains a&nbsp;viable player in&nbsp;the smartphone business I&nbsp;can see only one possible outcome if&nbsp;the scenario outlined above comes to&nbsp;pass: Microsoft will end up&nbsp;buying Nokia&rsquo;s mobile business. Steve cannot afford for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;turn out any other way. The decision will be&nbsp;rationalized by&nbsp;the Microsoft leadership team as&nbsp;a&nbsp;realization that&nbsp;&mdash; just like the XBox gaming business&nbsp;&mdash; the only way to&nbsp;compete with Apple and Google was to&nbsp;have control of&nbsp;the complete end to&nbsp;end consumer experience and that owning a&nbsp;smartphone manufacturer gives them the opportunity to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that.

Everyone involved is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;deny that this is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the cards but in&nbsp;the end this is&nbsp;Microsoft&rsquo;s likely Nokia nightmare and one they&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;deal with sooner rather than later.

[**Update:** 6/9/2011&nbsp;&mdash; Stephen Elop once again denies the company is&nbsp;up&nbsp;for sale while <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/09/nokia-ceo-denies-acquisition-rumors/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29" target="_blank">speaking at&nbsp;the Open Mobile Summit</a> in&nbsp;London today. Again I&nbsp;would point out that while Nokia is&nbsp;not actively being offered for sale that is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;prevent a&nbsp;hostile takeover attempt once the stock becomes too cheap to&nbsp;resist. The final decision may not be&nbsp;Stephen Elops to&nbsp;make.]
