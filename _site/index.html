      <div class="entry">
        <p>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve presented a more forward looking view of what lies beyond our current conception of cloud computing at <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-3rd-Era-Enabling-A-Composable-Future-Final.pdf" target="_blank">CloudConnect in Las Vegas</a>, a <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Beyond-Cloud.pdf" target="_blank">research symposium at UC Berkeley</a> and to the Northern California chapter of the <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Beyond-Cloud1.pdf" target="_blank">Young Presidents Organization</a>. I’ve used these presentations to outline an evolving set of ideas anchored around the idea that we’re in the middle of the 2nd Era of Computing rapidly evolving towards the 3rd Era. The organizing principle behind the ‘Era’ concept is the degree of coupling in and between application code and the underlying infrastructure.</p>

<p>“The digitally enabled economy is unleashing a new wave of change, something we are only just beginning to feel and understand. The economic evidence shows that this innovation -the development and adoption of new products, services, processes and business models - is vital to support rising living standards. But making the political case for the progressive power of innovation, and the digital economy, can be more challenging. The forces of ‘creative destruction’ threaten incumbent firms, jobs, and the way people work and live, creating strong incentives to oppose change. <span class="s1">Confronting these hard realities is one of the defining challenges for progressive politics in the 21</span><span class="s2"><sup>st</sup></span> <span class="s1">century.”</span></p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Anyone who has spent any time discussing cloud with me, or seen me present on cloud issues will no doubt quickly learn how fond I am of analogizing this technology domain with the automotive industry.</p>

<p>Our drive to solve the Time-to-Value problem and to implement continuous value delivery have deep rooted connections to the mass production innovations of Ford, the scientific management disciplines of Taylor and the far reaching Lean Production System invented by Toyota. As IT professionals we have - in my view - much to learn from the rich industrial heritage of high volume manufacturing processes.</p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to share my views on cloud computing and it’s implications for developing economies at the World Bank in DC. Preparing for this talk gave me the opportunity to crystalize my thinking on the Cloud-Manufacturing analogy and are synthesized in the slides I presented which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cloud-and-Industrialization-of-IT-Final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>One of my mother’s favortite sayings is “There’s no such thing as a free lunch” Generally that’s a pretty good rule to live buy. If it looks like your being offered something for nothing then take a second look. You’ll almost always end up paying somewhere down the line. However, when it comes to cloud computing a ‘Free Lunch’ may become a very real possibility.</p>

<p>Amazon, Microsoft and Google are engaged in a battle for market share and customer loyalty which has seen the price of basic computing resources decline preciptously over recent years. Therein lies the free lunch. However, each of them expects to monetize this growing customers base buy charging for higher level services. There’s the rub. Maximizing the free lunch oportunity will require smart customers to figure out how to dine inexpensively while limiting consumption of that expensive bottle of wine.</p>

<p>What impact will the increasingly widespread use of digital tools and information have on our society and economy and how will we deal with the disruptive forces brought to life and amplified by these technologies?</p>

<p>Understanding the nature of this emerging transformation and identifying appropriate responses to ensure we successfully navigate the challenges is critical. Without this we risk a level of social and economic dislocation unseen since our transition to an industrial economy in the 17th and 18th centuries. But whereas the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy took over one hundred years, the transition from industrial to a cyber-economy will likely take a few decades at most - a rate of change our political and social systems are ill-prepared to deal with.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In the economics of computing the most expensive resource is still the network. In scenarios where large data-sets are being processed it is almost always cheaper to move computation to the data than the other way round. My friend and former colleague Dave McCrory nicely captured this reality in his concept of <a href="http://blog.mccrory.me/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/" target="_blank">Data Gravity</a>.Today’s cloud based computing architectures assume that <em>all</em> data will flow to the center to be processed. Unfortunately, this centralized data-processing model is not likely to be economically viable as we look forward to a tsunami of data being generated by trillions of connected devices and sensors.</p>

<p>In the brave new world of the ‘Internet of Things’ - IoT - moving every bit of generated data from edge devices to the center for processing will likely make little economic sense. A new distributed data processing architecture is going to be required.</p>

<p>Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) are a common way of efficiently moving data from the center to the edge of the network but a new generation of Content Aggregation Networks (CANs) may be required to make the processing of IoT data economically viable - is there a ‘CAN’ in your future?</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I’m delighted to make available our new publication “The Services Dilemma” as a <a title="The Service Dilemma" href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Services-Dilemma-book.pdf" target="_blank">free eBook download</a></p>

<p>###The Services Transformation and the algorithmic revolution###</p>

<p>A fundamental, multi-tiered transformation of services is underway. It is so pervasive and of such scope that it entails a transformation of global competitive economics. First of all, it is part of a dynamic in the global economy, which not only adds to the relative growth of services, but leads to most businesses integrating a services component into their business model. Secondly, the very nature of services is being transformed, driven by developments in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools, the uses to which they are being put, and the networks on which they run. Finally, there is an emerging strategic challenge for services companies that are using ICT to ad- dress the classical productivity challenge in services, concerning the need to avoid commoditization.</p>

<p>The consequences of this fundamental transformation of services impact the nature and the distribution of jobs globally; they change the strategic requirements for success in all kinds of businesses and they pose significant new challenges for economic policy.</p>

<p>In this <a href="http://www.adamalthus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Services-Dilemma-book.pdf" target="_blank">white book</a>, we will map the entirety of the services transformation and its implication for services innovation. We will be discussing the strategic business choices that are being posed—in some core sections and case studies with a particular focus on smaller services companies—as well as some key public policy challenges.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>The business of Information Technology (IT) has a <em>complexity</em> problem.</p>

<p>As a domain IT requires deeply specialized skills, the language of IT is arcane and business needs require multiple levels of translation and interpretation before being implemented as systems. This conceptual complexity creates a significant barrier between business and IT leadership. But there’s a bigger problem: The most <em>complex</em> issue facing IT today is technology itself.</p>

<p>The IT infrastructure of most reasonably sized businesses is a horrendous <em>cats cradle</em> of interconnection and information flow between multiple aging systems that were never designed to work together and yet the emergence of horizontally integrated - and increasingly globally distributed - business processes demands and depends on the friction free flow of information.</p>

<p><em>Time-to-Value</em> is perhaps the most important metric in today’s dynamic, competitive service-led economy but against this measure most corporate IT organizations fail miserably. The requirement for IT to keep pace with the speed of business has never been greater but the ugly reality for most CIOs is that the <em>complexity</em> of their IT infrastructures is overwhelming and an increasing percentage of IT budgets is now spent on maintaining and integrating aging legacy systems rather than delivering new value to the business.</p>

<p>No wonder most CEOs are skeptical about the strategic value of IT.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>An interesting debate took place at last week’s <a href="http://cloud2020summit.com/" target="_blank">Cloud2020</a> gathering regarding the viability of futures markets for cloud computing capacity. I’m firmly at the skeptical end of the spectrum as the title of this post will attest. However, I had not given enough thought as to the reasons for my skepticism. Having reflected on it a little I’m more convinced than ever that any attempt to create either primary or secondary markets in cloud commodities is doomed. In short the lack of friction and a lack of volatility in matching cloud computing supply and demand means there is likely no window for 3rd party market makers to insert themselves into this value network.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>We have witnessed a major shift over recent decades towards a digital services based economy. Exponential growth in the power of information technology enhanced by Internet driven network effects mean that even the most mundane manufactured products are seen as just one component of a broader digital services based value chain.</p>

<p>The shift to digital services has transformed the global competitive landscape. Maintaining competitive differentiation requires continuous innovation – and lifecycles are contracting. In other words change is a constant. The dynamics of a hyper-competitive global market mean that static and long-lived models of company structure, operations and information technology services are no longer fit for purpose.

<p>The first three laws of platform economics are: <em>Value always migrates up the stack, _Value gets integrated over time, _Those that control platform evolution get to define how value is extracted.</em>__ A definition of each of the ‘Laws’ is provided below:</p>

      <h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/30/do-not-track-internet-business/">How 'Do Not Track' Will Transform Internet Business Models</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Imagine a world where all internet browsers are required to present users with a simple question: “Do you want your online browsing activity tracked, recorded and shared with marketing companies - Yes or No?”</p>

<p>What percentage of users do you suppose would answer “No?” My guess would be greater than 90%. If I’m anywhere close to being correct then Microsoft’s <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2012/october/default-browser-do-not-track-setting-will-result-in-less-online-content-say-advertisers/" target="_blank">controversial decision</a> to enable ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_track" target="_blank">Do Not Track</a>’ (DNT) by default in IE10 and Windows 8 would seem to be very much inline with consumer sentiment. But <a href="http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/analetter-microsoft" target="_blank">advertisers</a>, <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20121026/yahoo-dings-do-not-track-default-and-search-partner-microsoft/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>, and the developers of both the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/apache-webserver-updated-to-ignore-do-not-track-settings-in-ie-10/" target="_blank">Apache web server</a> and <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2012/05/31/do-not-track-its-the-users-voice-that-matters/" target="_blank">FireFox</a> browsers are all decrying Microsoft’s decision.</p>

<p>This relatively arcane debate over a new internet standard masks a much more critical issue: In the long-term, how viable is the internet’s - advertising based - ‘Free’ content model?</p>

<p>Advertising revenue is the internet’s predominant business model. This is of course the core business model that enabled Google to become the 800 lb. gorilla of the industry. But this business model is based on users accepting a ‘Faustian’ pact where they agree to increasingly invasive tracking of their online activities in exchange for free content.</p>

<p>There’s only one small problem with the current situation. Very few consumers have ever read or consented to the ‘Contract.’ Most of consumers have no earthly idea how invasive today’s internet tracking technology is and once they are aware they are not going to like it.</p>

It is starting to become clear that - as Steve Ballmer <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar12/shareholder-letter/index.html" target="_blank">recently announced</a> - Microsoft is deadly serious about becoming a global leader in consumer “Devices and Services.” Successful execution of this strategy will require the company to control everything from manufacturing, distribution logistics through to retail.</p>

<p>The company appears to be focused on executing a ‘Leader’ strategy in the devices business which would give them even greater control than Apple famously does over the end user experience. In addition the company is likely to repurpose its online service investments to add value to this new device-led strategy. A-la Apple, consumers will have no choice but to use Microsoft own services when using a Microsoft mobile device and competition authorities will be powerless to prevent it.</p>

        <p>This <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/phillipkeys/2012/05/31/network-equipment-manufacturers-try-to-help-out-mobile-carriers/" target="_blank">article</a> in Forbes magazine about network equipment providers enabling network carriers to expose service APIs (Application Programing Interfaces) started an interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanmurray/status/209309211614642176" target="_blank">debate</a> with Alcatel-Lucent’s Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/magicmerl" target="_blank">@magicmerl</a>), Mike Maney (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/the_spinmd" target="_blank">@the_spinmd</a>) and others on Twitter.</p>

<p>The crux of the debate is whether exposing developer APIs at the network layer is a good or a bad thing. This is the latest round in the ‘dumb pipes vs. smart network’ debate which lies at the heart of an economic dilemma facing the network carrier business model.</p>

        <p>“Cloud computing” is much more than simply a new set of technologies and business models. It is rapidly emerging as the platform that will underpin the next generation of digital products and services. Cloud Computing is transforming how consumers, companies, and governments store information, how they process and exchange that information, and how they utilize computing power. Consequently, it opens a new set of policy discussions while at the same time underlining the importance of old debates.</p>

<p>The UK’s Royal Society has just <a title="BBC News" href="http://bit.ly/clQa61" target="_blank">announced</a> a major new research project on the implications of population growth. The study is to be headed by the Nobel Laureate, Sir John Sulston. As the RI points out populations studies is quite a cyclical area of research. The ’60s and ’70s were a boom time for the field with less focus being given the the subject in the ’80s and ’90s. The fact that the topic is moving back up the political agenda probably has much to do with the intersection of population on two key policy issues; economic growth and climate change.</p>

        <p>It has been fun being back in Beijing this week. My first visit to the city was in 1989 when the streets were still filled with bicycles. I’ve been back here about once a year since then yet the pace of progress on so many levels is still hard to comprehend. Growth of the ‘Starbucks Index’ alone is mind blowing and seems to be reaching Seattle or New York densities.</p>
