  <h1>About Adamalthus</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Jonathan Murray (Adamalthus) is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Digital Prism Advisors. His unique blend of large enterprise sales, operating and business strategy and policy experience combined with a deep expertise in modern software architecture and engineering makes him the ideal partner for clients needing to understand and address the complex factors at play in today’s data driven digital transformation.</p>

<p>Jonathan was most recently engaged as interim CTO and Head of Technology at The New York Times. Prior to this he was Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Technology Officer at Warner Music Group (WMG) where he was responsible for the company’s global technology strategy. In this role he drove the transformation of WMG’s technology capabilities, the implementation of a new cloud computing based software delivery factory and new organizational and process models. This experience provided Jonathan with a unique perspective on the disruption of traditional organization structures, jobs and business models being wrought by a new generation of technologies, digital tools and platforms.</p>

<p>Jonathan created the concept of a ‘Composable Enterprise’, which provides a radical blueprint for enabling highly adaptive and agile business models enabled by modern software architectures and platforms. He believes that ‘Time-to-Value’ should be the key success metric for all enterprise technology organizations and that a comprehensive transformation of enterprise software platforms, processes and organization structures will be required to accomplish this. His agenda-defining presentation at the 2013 Cloud Foundry summit is widely seen as a road-map for next generation of enterprise IT.</p>

<p>Jonathan is a published research fellow with the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy at the University of California, Berkeley and an advisor to the Bacharach Leadership Group out of Cornell University’s Institute of Labor Relations. He is an advisor to the CEO and executive leadership team of Komatsu Corporation as a member of their Innovation and Technology Advisory Board.</p>

<p>Jonathan is a regular speaker on cloud computing technology and policy issues and an advisor to several technology investment funds, the World Bank, European Commission, the OECD and The Conference Board. In 2012 was recognized as one of the leading cloud-computing visionaries and in 2014 Jonathan was elected to The Economist’s ‘Agenda Digital 50’.</p>

<p>Previously, Jonathan spent sixteen years in various executive roles with Microsoft including Vice President of the company’s Public Sector Technology Office and Vice President of Global Account Sales where he was responsible for leading Microsoft’s engagement with its top enterprise customers. Prior to joining Microsoft Jonathan held a number of systems architecture and design roles with ARCO International Oil and Gas. He has an extensive background in software engineering, architecture and systems design and a formal education in geology and earth sciences.</p>
